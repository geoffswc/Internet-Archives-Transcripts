good afternoon everybody, thanks for coming down on such short notice and also welcome everybody here in the cafeteria 120 Park would also those who are on p.m. TV and watching us and as well as some people around the world who are on just an audio feed with me today are Bill Webb our cheif Operating Officer Chuck wall or general counsel and Mike semantic president/ceo of Philip Morris USA as Bill will mention just a few minutes Jeff obviously would be here but he is out of the country and Bill, here representing Jeff each one of those three gentlemen will have a few things to say bill is going to deliver some remarks that Jeff wrote Because he wanted for everybody to hear what he was feeling today Chuck is going to explain what has happened what the next steps are and try to give everybody a sense of why we feel pretty good about our chances are feel very good about our chances of having this thing reversed ultimately, on a peel and then Mike is going to say a few things I'll come back real quickly at the end of that for a couple of comments and then we'll take your questions so without further Ado Chief Operating Officer Philip Morris companies go web, thank you Steve good afternoon good evening everybody Jeff is in fact on his way back here he didn't leave this afternoon when he heard the verdict although one might be tempted to do that he he's on his way back he was on an overseas business trip with the long-standing commitment so he's asked me to read these comments which he had planned to give in the event that this unfortunate verdict came out, as you may have guessed we are here to talk about the angle jury decision in the verdict in the amount of one hundred and forty five billion dollars against the industry and seventy four billion dollars against Philip Morris in a few moments I'm going to ask Chuck wall to give you some details about the verdict what happens next and while we why we feel so positive about the future of this particular case, but before he does I'd like to give you my perspective of where we are and it's reflective of what I said in the desk drop we issued immediately after the after the verdict came out which was about an hour or so ago, it is an understatement to say that this is not a good verdict, but it is not a surprise either and I can assure you that in typical Philip Morris fashion we prepared for every possibility that we could think of, those of you who have followed this case know that the deck seem to be stacked against us from the very start rulings went against us on a remarkably consistent basis before and throughout the trial and I am certain the aim of the Court was to get us to settle this case, well we didn't settle and we won't settle because the law is on our side we intend and we expect to get through this and be Vindicated in the end, it might take a long time because of the lengthy nature of the judicial process but we will eventually get there, we will launch our appeal as soon as the Florida law permits Chuck will explain in more detail about that in just a few moments, I'm not going to pretend that the post verdict and appeal process is going to be smooth and easy I expect there will be events and Court decisions that we will not be happy about but at the end of the day whenever that day comes and it will we will finally be free of this class action case and we will emerge Victorious and stronger than before, I can't thank you enough for sticking with us through this tortuous litigation I am sure they were mornings when some of you woke up and asked yourselves when will it ever end, believe me I had plenty of those mornings myself, so please continue to stick with us have confidence in our ability to work through it and focus on where we expect to come out, to you and to your families whom I'm sure felt some moments of anxiety reading about the case in the newspapers I want to express my deepest appreciation for your support I'm sure it has not been easy for many of you or them, I'm sure they were times when it was extremely difficult wondering what all this meant to the company especially when we were under a gag order that prevented us from speaking to you, but you've made it through this difficult period with flying colors I might add given the state of our businesses and you are with us today for that I'm extremely grateful thank you each and every one of you for having confidence in us and making sure our businesses stayed humming and moving forward and now let me turn it over to Chuck to explain the legal situation in more detail Chuck, thank you very much bill before I get into the verdict and trying to explain what I must say is a rather complicated process but I will do my very best to explain it to you let me tell you a little bit some of the things that this verdict is not the result of, first of all it's not the result of the testimony of Mike semantics and Ellen Merlot who are terrific it is they went down to the arena as I call it down there and I think Dan web calls it and talked about Philip Morris the company today and talked about the employees of Philip Morris they were absolutely terrific, it is not about Dan web and a wonderful team he put together with his law firm of Winston's Tron they were absolutely spectacular, and it is not about the efforts of the in-house lawyers here particularly John mode Eric and Greg Little who have worked so hard on this case for so long and have done an absolutely terrific job, those people are to be congratulated although they don't ask for congratulations and we owe them a real debt of gratitude although they don't seek it because of the time and the effort they put in on our behalf, what is verdict is in my judgement is the result of a very badly flawed process, we are the victims of it and I believe the jury is the victim of it as well, and as a lawyer I must say that I'm embarrassed about a system that is so flawed and a judge who I must say is been so biased, this is not just a tobacco issue, it is an issue that involves all of us who are interested in a judicial system that is fair and a fair process it is about every corporation who is interested in a fair and just judicial system, now this may sound like somebody complaining about a very bad result in part it probably is but I think we have a great deal of justification, it is actually a verdict in favor of no one as Dan web and billmeyer have said today because the class members are unknown, we do not know who will be participating in this verdict in the award today because they have not been identified and their cases have yet to be tried, that is a process that could take many many years, and there's one of the reasons I believe the process is so flawed, we have said before that the certification of this class was wrong, 28 out of 31 cases have been found not to be susceptible to class certification in state and federal courts in this country 28 out of 31 decisions and the three decisions are the Engel case which we are in the process of right now the burrowing case which was the etas case we settled some years ago and a case pending in Louisiana, in every other instance when the courts have addressed the issue of whether a class should be certified in a smoking and health case the courts have said no that is a further indication of why this is a flawed process, it is a flawed process because the judge himself is a member of the class, the case in the case in which he has been sitting and he refused to remove himself from the case, it is a flawed process because it defies common sense and the law to have a punitive damage damage has decided in a some of this amount before a single case has been tried
