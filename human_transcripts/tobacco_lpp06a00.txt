Are there about in the the quote that you have remained correct, to follow up on the line of questioning at the chairman, ask and let me go to Mr. Aiken I know Mr. Aiken and know more about his operation and even though he's a little bigger than most of us in East Tennessee the situation that he outlined with respect to his farming operation is pretty typical Mr. Aiken is it not with respect to the cost that you incur and and the amount of net profit you get per pound. So I would ask all of you now, if how many of you are still selling in tobacco auction, and nobody's raising their hand all right to of course portion. Pardon, a portion of portion at auction, but you would agree that in the way the situation is developing at auctions will soon be out of the picture do you agree to that and then we'll be left to contract selling, and are all of you now selling under contract. Yes sir, well it doesn't make sense to you that if if the FDA should get into the picture and if the FDA should put regulations on the manufacturers that those are simply going to be passed through to you as producers through the Contracting provision. How many years for those of you who've been contracting, how many years have you been contracted but mr. Carter. I had opportunity probably the contract a certain portion of my tobacco before anyone else because I grow portion of my tobacco organically and I've been under contract and that regard for six years on that portion of tobacco and that point and the point you're trying to make is that yes as time has goes by more has been demanded of what has occurred on my farm but, I can assure you that the cost of Regulation is of concern to Growers and they certainly don't want FDA intimately involved on their Farm but that I can take you to three or four my neighbors whose Farm I now attend because they were no longer a viable unit if they had the opportunity to advance forward with some degree of profitability and a reasonable degree of FDA regulation they would rather be farming and me renting their farm and I think that's the situation that we've been placed, it in its Growers is it's only been 4-5 years since we had her plastered all over our trucks no FDA on the farm and it was not a grower issue it was a cigarette manufacturer issue and we were trying to help them fight that battle and I think right now it's still currently a cigarette manufacturing issue and we're just in the situation that we've bought into the idea and firmly believe that if the air regulations coming we need to we need to proactively, of  accept that as portion of what we need to get a quote of bile and I'm not saying we were but at the same time we need to realistically understand that those contractual Provisions have grown more stringent sir that in the six years that you have dealt with them and and there was no reason for them to other than the the yes sir considerations of the contract between the company and the grower. yes sir and, well to get that let me ask mr. mr. rat did you want to comment on that or yes of Congressman Jenkins there are many farmers in Southwest Jane I'm sure right across the line over in your area that that would like to have an opportunity to continue with auction system I've heard many say you know hey we're at the mercy of the company now, we dont have a nap and the point that you made is that if we have to continue Contracting it's going to be through that contract that a lot can be dictated by FDA and whether the farmer can live with that or not I don't know, time will only tell so we must be very very very cautious as we drag this legislation thank you Mr. Wright, my time is expired Mr. chairman thank you Mr. Jenkins gentleman from North Carolina Mr. McIntyre thank you Mr. chairman. I just like short answer this first question from each of you what will happen to you if we don't get a buy out this year, will you be able to continue to produce some tobacco how, I will it affect you, we'll just go down the table  could. As I look across this panel I think I'm the youngest youngest member testifying today, I'm 40 years old and as I said in my testimony I made a commitment to grow tobacco I don't have a lot of other options in the East Tennessee my wife and I made a commitment to work hard and and we thought we had a master plan when we got married my debt load, for the last two years has actually increased that's not completely due to the I mean there's other factors weather-related and those things and I accepted those going in I did not know initially when I went into the tobacco business that I would be looking at the uncertainties that we have in the last couple of years I still need to produce tobacco I still want to produce tobacco but I would hope that we could get some more stability. Congressman obviously most of us would anticipate if there's not a quota by all that we do experience another massive quota cut I think that my situation must be fairly similar to Mr. Akins just a year or two older than he is we thought we made a very conscious plan realizing that the industry was changing we've invested we thought prudently and position ourselves for the future in the industry there's no way that you can plan for 50 and 60 percent quota cuts no matter how prudent you, our thank you. Congressman I'm sure help will still be producing tabacco but at the last level than I am now in 1998 99, I produced 192 thousand pounds this year I'm down to 105 thousand pound I'm sure that's going to be less next year now I'm also diverse find out into a bigger cattle operation. How to will continue to raise the debacle but the problem mentioned how small we were for with the cuts we've had in the last few years I've actually picked up Laces every year but yet I'm less the bog of than I was four or five years ago if I look at it scares me sometimes when I look at the land that's under my control it's over 1,000 acres and I'm raising 25 x to the bike that's how much Farmland is tied up and at some of grand some of that is Temple and a lot of it past you, land but you guys will continue have to raise the bike if I'm going to say that. Cost will continue to go up producers will have less and less net income as a result and will become less and less competitive in these Global markets that we're forced to compete in these days. Barney to buy quotas in Southwest Virginia very small to start with and this year I would say that probably 200 Acres of tobacco was not put out in Washington County alone just because the quotas had been shrunken so much that it wasn't profitable to go out there and put out a half acre tobacco which is about the size of a, for Washington County, Virginia the county I live in all will I be raising the back and next year, next year will only tell if things continue to go the way they have the last five years we're going to be out in Southwest Virginia. Thank you very much and Mr. Chairman the interest of time. I would just ask on each of the panelists given the importance of the buyout that if for some reason we did not get a buyout we're going to be left with having to deal with the current program and that concerns all of us just as it concerns you I would ask each of the panelists if you would submit in writing just a simple list to the committee of what changes would need to be made in the current tobacco program if for some reason about does not occur you know where I am on this issue, we've made that clear from the beginning we want to buy out but if for some reason we don't get where we need to be for whatever reason it may be outside of the control of this committee it may be something that happens that we don't control over on the floor or on the other body on the other side of the hill but if we were not to get a buyout we still need to do some things to help you so if you would submit a list Mr. chairman that would be permissible in writing in answer to this question of what changes could occur in the tobacco program that would help you in the event for some reason I'm out, it did not occur thank you Mr. Chairman. That request is a good one and at the end of the hearing we will ask unanimous consent to keep the record open for 10 days to allow the witnesses to respond time's up. I thank you gentlemen recognize the gentleman from Ohio Mr. Boehner was Jeremiah and thank you for holding this hearing over the last five years or so I've spent countless hours talking to Farmers tobacco Farmers members who are interested in a buy out and we've had some rather spirited discussions the gentleman from Tennessee Mr. Jenkins and I have often had this discussion I'm glad that we're going to have it out in the open today, our government over the last 30 years has had a policy of discouraging Smoking and during that time we've had countless efforts to try to reduce the amount of the number of people who smoke cigarettes cigars and other tobacco products while at the same time the members of this committee I have gone out of their way trying to find a way to help the plight tobacco farmers, and as a member who who often Comes Here to cause Trouble we keep working against each other and I appreciate the plight of tobacco Farmers it's a tough business the you work guard the returns are good if the weather is good but your government continues to work against you and so but when we look at the plight of tobacco Farmers we can look at the plight, Airline workers we could look at the plight of Steel Workers we could look at the plight of Auto Workers Industries who continue to have difficult trouble and those cases a lot of that troubles coming from foreign competition but then we come along with the master settlement agreement 1998 200 billion dollars that the companies have agreed to to reduce litigation including, being five billion dollars of that to go to Tobacco farmers and then over the last couple of years because of the plight of the tobacco industry Congress approved a 328 million dollars in tobacco lost payments for farmers in 2000 another 340 million dollars in 2001 another 129 million dollars in fiscal 01 and fifty three million dollars and 03 and now in, addition to 661 million dollars of no net crossed price support alone an interest losses for the 99 crop here so the government's spending money tobacco companies are losing money tobacco farmers are losing money but you know what interests me the most, that in the twelve and a half years that I've been here I've never had one discussion I've never heard one discussion in this body about those of us who smoke, no one on the floor of the house or in this committee is ever talked about who is really paying for all of this, do you look up to the master settlement agreement 208 million dollars did the companies get hurt yes, they've got less volume higher prices but who paying the cost of this, the people who smoke cigarettes. About 50 60 cents a pack cost increase so far because of the master settlement agreement now add to that the cost increases we see on excise tax increases my home state of Ohio just had a massive increase in a year ago averaged carton of cigarettes in my home States increased about ten dollars over the last two years and in when you begin to look at the average cost of a carton of Marlboro, the 1998 between 1998 and today the average cost for a carton of Marlboro cigarettes is now 17 dollars higher than it was, so if you begin to look at what's happened here is that we're raising the prices on consumers, and as we're in a as a way of trying to stay in business we see all of these imported cigarette. I got some numbers here in in in 1997 there were about seven point eight billion sticks cigarettes brought into the country from non-participating manufacturers last year the number was almost 20 and i need my glasses, it's about 28 billion cigarettes brought in that again non-participating manufacturers and so we've got the company's being squeezed we've got tobacco farmer of being squeezed and we've got consumers being squeezed all at a time that the big policy here gives what we want to put everybody out of business. It sounds like it's working and so as I as I looked listen to, to Tobacco buy out. The first question I ask myself is until we stop this cycle of killing each other on all end and we better figure out what what that solution really is, is the solution to add more energy to this fight against each other because if we do the by out who's going to pay for it it's not going to be the company's it's not going to be the government it's going to be the customers thereby increasing prices higher pulling more demand more pressure on Imports which is going to drive the amount of domestic tobacco produced down increasing the plight of tobacco Farmers even worse than it is today. So I would just suggest to my colleagues that before we take another step in the wrong direction that we step back and look at at a policy that really will help improve the lot of tobacco farmers and others that are involved in this industry now and I'm just afraid that the buyout itself really in the end isn't the answer I think you're going to get FDA controls that in this bill I don't see how Bill can move without having the FDA over, involved in this process these licenses that are called for in these bills to replace the current photo program are we going to have to buy the licenses back at some point possibly we got Amber back from Amber box problems and then we're going to ask those who aren't involved in the use of of domestically produced tobacco I the the cigar producers who use imported tobacco we're going to ask them to pay for part of the program and I make it in the end we just need we need to find out what the real solution is but I'm concerned that the solution The Only Solution on the table today is to take is to take, the battle to those who are the consumers means that the consumers out there and I'm one of them I'm not going to deny it if I put them out there that consumers out there I want to be represented somewhere in this discussion they haven't been thus far and I'm afraid the solution is on the table today only puts all of the costs on the consumer while in the end not doing anything to really solve the problem. I thank the gentleman the gentleman from North Carolina Mr. Etheridge, thank you Mr. Chairman let me thank you and the ranking member for old and me and let me thank each of the farmers who are represented here today and especially Mr. Karna who who has done an excellent job in our state as past president of Tabacco growers association in North Carolina Mr. Keith shares somewhere in the audience who we also the past go and I would say to my colleague he has submitted written testimony I hope you and your staff are read along with the testimony from the North Carolina Farm Bureau was laying Wooten who's President who's here today so we appreciate you being here. This is an important day and I think as we move through it and listen to other testimony it's going to become more Crystal Clear let me just make a point about something the ranking member said earlier and I think this is critical to understand having grown up on a farm and at a time when small farmers could make it when there was the potential profit in tabacco, and on small farms it's not there anymore for a whole variety of reasons which I don't have time to go into space required Farmers to go to volumes as a result of volumes increased costs and increase called as required more volume than Cuts so you get the cycle so it won't go into it but one of the things I have heard you could you say this morning I think it's important is it you willing to be flexible and that you most of you support the concept in h.r. 245 of, that I've co-sponsored with pain to pleasure now being flexible is important as business as you've heard from my colleagues already and you hear from others I think mr. MacIntyre said in his opening comments then obviously going to get won't but if we work together hopefully we can come up with a plan that will work and be helpful I hope we will hear the same kind of comment than the next two pound they're willing to be flexible and to try to find a solution out of this because the truth is we're losing farmers, one of the points that was made as relates to a lot holders that I think we tend to forget sometimes most of the allotment holders in this country either bought it or it was set in place in the 30th and it's been bought or purchased through with land and it's very hard to sell it without it unless you dispose of the land and land wind up going in to houses and that'll happen if you live near town we've lived in a rural area kind of hard to separate it and not many people want to buy, and that right so simply put it's time to get the job done and I think this hearing you and your participation is important as we move in that reality as head to torta buy out because I think that is one of the answers we can get to. Let me ask each of you we respond to this one question the group quickly because I've been hearing a lot from our farmers in North Carolina and happened to represent one of the largest Luke here tobacco growing regions in the country, and here they have that North Carolina you certainly have any country as agricultural leaders for your respective State can you share more with us about how the dire situation of farmers are in your area right now weather can be part of it but the broader issues as it relates to the issues of debt load of you mention it in different pieces debt load, features how we going to track young farmers and I don't think we should forget, reason we have so many small farmers in North Carolina is because we've had to buy I think things through in each of the other states you'll touch on that very quickly. I would have to say that I'm fortunate to come from a family farm you know my father and mother helped me get started if not for that it would been virtually impossible for me to proceed into agriculture but I think the last two years have been very very difficult, for all producers not not just tobacco producers because you know we're looking at prices that some of us have not seen in our in our lifetime and as far as the price will you receive for our Commodities the prices we pay for them put cost of you know continue to rise so I think we're looking at the tough times. As you go down the line give us some sense of what capitalization would cost if someone going to get into farming today and tabacco, another thing you do to please thank you. The Congressman is when two of the most difficult years in a row that we've ever experienced on the farm severe drought followed by excessive moisture a modest crop at best in the field and that's describing it liberally and as I indicated earlier one of my questions we've been very fortunate in our farming operation record of closely maintain the same level production that we had several years, ago but it's been at the expense of neighbors who fell below the threshold of having a sufficient size of operation to capitalize what they were doing or to maintain a labor force and I currently grow the tobacco that six of my peers grew in 1998 they're all displaced they're all in middle-aged and older have tried to find other jobs and trying to subsist on the income that they generate from the quota rental that I pay them which I might indicate escalates every year, price on a per unit basis so it's been it's a difficult time on the farm and not just in the back of mr. Aiken indicated you have a lot of other Commodities in your District you know how the cotton crop is suffering there are just a number of things that are in play right now the cost of capitalization and flue-cured back is extraordinary if you were to consider trying to get in at this point in time the bulk curing facility a minimum is 20 thousand dollars per unit that can accommodate seven or eight Acres of the backup, and this is very specialized assets has no value outside of the youth were tobacco the bulk Tobacco Barn is basically good heated storage if you don't cure tabacco in it it says idle for nine months out of the year so it's a real prohibitive factor from someone just happened to think they might want to grow tabacco. It's also very prohibited if you want to try to put yourself in a position to advance and this industry if there is what if future post by up so it's a very difficult in business too, work your way into. In my community the land price has gone up to three thousand dollars plus an acre because we've kind of becoming a bedroom community where 50 they 80 miles and any general direction of three big large cities people wanting to leave the large cities and move and when you're trying to farm you can't afford to pay 3000 dollars an acre for the land in there to raise tobacco that you're back in very small profit owner the cattle that you've got there trying to make small porfit on, so we are competing with that we're losing Farmers every day to that's going to least in their crops out going to get the job to supplement their income to make it better and that that's what's going on in my community, I don't think it's any way somebody that's not involved in farm or in in tobacco farm and no matter how crazy he was, could justify the capitalization to go into it right now and I never have believed that with posed by out or no bio the only thing that I hope is this plenty of young Growers on the farm. Children that I hope that they have opportunity say that because like where we live no matter that the quote has been cut our tax rates at the County revenue office have not been cut they still consider it to be, taxable and they still are rasing in the taxes we are less and less have less representation on the County Board of Supervisors but yet our tax rates have not fail even though we've got less quota to pay it with. But Mr. Etheridge I'm here representing American Farm Bureau but your question is more directed to South Carolina we're coming off of a period of five years of drought to a year this year where we have had unusually heavy rains and I don't appear to be on appreciative because we really appreciate the rain but the mood in agriculture and South Carolina is probably as dim and as depressed as I as I have ever seen it profits are, harder and harder to come by we find ourselves in an even more and more competitive situation globally so many questions from biotechnology to WTO and where agriculture is headed in general that the need to be answered specifically you asked about getting into agriculture I think of a a unit size of operation that would be reasonable with tobacco cotton corn a diversified operation would probably take, about two million dollars to get into in South Carolina at this point one other thing I'd like to mention to you. Everybody today either bought tabacco of quota or they paid inherited taxes on it whenever they whenever they got it from their predecessors, one recommend any young man to go in or try to go into the tobacco business right now no way as you know tobacco has paid for many a small farm in Southwest Virginia and they bought that farm it had that tobacco quote on it and that's what I paid for it today that that's not happening no way so when we recommended it all and also considering the fact that you know Dairy, cesare an all-time low our Dairy Farmers are suffering tremendously if it wasn't for the little subsidy that they're getting no way could they continue all you know and whether this year probably the worst year I can remember what tabacco and According to Dr. Jones and Blackstone to research station this is the worst year since nineteen and fifty one for tobacco crop in the Commonwealth of Virginia. So for these reasons I don't think it's would be a good decision to try to get in it this time. Thank you, thank you Mr. Chairman I yield thanks from Georgia Mr. Burns recognized thank you Mr. Chairman I thank Chairman ranking member for holding this hearing today and certainly the work of Mr. Jenkins and Mr. McIntyre I represent an area of Georgia has to give it to back and I'd like to thank panel for their input and also like to point out the fact that your use of things language is absolutely appropriate and I'm delighted to have been washed and we need more folks who speak Southern up here I want to want to follow up on, couple things first of all Mr. Etheridge pointed out that they're very very few if any first generation Farmers out there I mean it's just as you all pointed out it's virtually impossible for someone who did not grow up in that environment environment and have family connections and support mechanisms there to make a go of it today in American agriculture we know that another thing I want to follow back up on his when we start talking about marketing your product we've gone from the auction environment to a more of contract, production what percentage are you seeing now contract versus auction Barnes we're losing auction barns all over in my area of the country mr. Aiken I would say between 80 and 90% in Tennessee last year was contract contracted it's basically 80% is industry figure in my areas probably 90 percent 98 yes sir okay Kentucky in my county and, surrounding counties it's probably 95 percent, pretty high yes I think it's close to 90% in my area figures around 80 to 90% but of course you realize one of the major companies just announced they would furnish a hundred percent of their needs by contract this year and accept no auction-based that's correct problem okay, probably 95% and in Southwest Virginia by plus. How does that marketing shift effect the tobacco producer, that an advantage to use put you at a disadvantage is this would you prefer one method over the other or is it just the way the market is moved.

I think I think every tobacco producers should have the opportunity to sell either way if he wants to contract our right or if he wants to put it on the auction flow and and and let them duke it out for his to bike of then he should have that opportunity and if he, no other opportunity other than contract then he is at the mercy of one, now I remember as a boy growing up going to the auction Barn always done it to be a very pleasant experience spend spend the day in the evening there and and just go through the the Americana of at the back auction it's quite enjoyable let me ask a specific question mr. Winkle in your testimony you were you point out that that one of the things you'd like to see as a safety net and adequate safety net for tobacco producers would you elaborate a little bit on that, number of producers would like to see a very strong safety net even including you know systems very much like in place with the farm bill others are much more others have a much more liberal feeling of that not quite as concerned about it so it is a wide range there mr. mr. Congressman anywhere from anywhere from is much, poured from the form of ldp use and blown put the prices all the way down to no support whatsoever now whatever the final decision is I've no our Growers will be happy with that decision and live with it I think the number one question though is whether they'll be a buyout of that Equity that has been built up in that quota I think that you know that that leads me to my final question if indeed we are able to achieve a successful buyout which is going to be a challenge we know, oh that but if we are to achieve our able to achieve that result then I want to look at post by out production controls or management what what recommendations are how would you feel if you support a licensing program do you support you know some form of traditional carryover from The Producers perspective you know give me your input on a post production environment, in Virginia we felt that if we could keep it in a geographical areas but again I think a lot of it boils back a lot of the questions on the FDA if you're in a contract agreement man is buying your product will tell you that to come to his I don't believe won't all that debacle grown in one area I think they going they're gonna move the production where they want and I think where it's at now scattered from Florida to Virginia is how they wish it to be and I think they'll control that reasonable FDA Authority does, hear us on the phone because we feel like the man is buying our product is going to tell us how he wants it and if it's reasonable I think we can live with it on the phone, they being from East Tennessee we cannot transfer to row crops or anything else basically we lose tobacco it would be very detrimental to the producers and a lot of rural communities so again I would hope that we could save some Geographic protections you know I got to admit to you I am I'm an optimist and I think Moby Maybe, everyone at this panel would have to be a little bit to be involved in farming so I want to tell you that that I have high hopes for tobacco production regardless of what type of program or Safeguard we come out with but the problem is my banker is not quite as much of an optimist as I am so for that for that reason when you go to make in large-scale investments into into a tobacco crop, to me it's almost necessary or makes it very beneficial if I can have some Safeguard to present to my banker and those type folks I think is a minimum we need to look at restricting it to the geographical areas that we're in concurrently because even with a four dollar transition to assist Growers and the opportunity to move forward in a new type of marketing opportunity or it offers them the opportunity to transition to something else the community is still suffering, I think that it's maybe it's unfortunate but so many of these rural economies are based on agricultural production and as you've heard from the testimony there is no opportunity to do your traditional row crops in the laws of places where tobacco actually thrives so I think it's critical that we maintain that portion of it it's also probably important that we look at a minimal production controls in order that we're not constantly over supplying or under supplying the market, demand and a lot of that obviously will be taken care of through contractual Arrangements but there probably needs to be some oversight in that regard to administered by Growers and along with the industry in relation to what they see as a desirable amounts of a kind of grow in any given year Diamonds Gentleman's expired gentleman from Kentucky mr. Lucas thank you mr. chairman and I'd like to welcome all you folks here this has been invaluable your testimony and particularly like the welcome David Chapple who's, been a friend of mine for a long time and David we've got a lot of folks from Kentucky that are up here today in the other room because they realize the importance of this buyout and it's it's almost a life or death situation for us back in Kentucky because their survival of our farming Community is dependent I believe I'm getting a reasonable buyout and this has been long overdue, when I travel my district back in Kentucky this issue outweighs anything and everything all the other issues put together I mean it's that important and I think the time is now for this by out if we don't get it done this year I really questioned if we'll ever get it done being the eternal optimist the other thing I would say to I'm very hopeful that since, tobacco is not the most politically correct product out there that are farmers and ranchers produce across this country I'm very hopeful that we will get the empathy and support of our other AG State colleagues who we support them and we're very hopeful that they'll be supportive of us when it comes to trying to work out a solution here today I think that's that's very important food being the eternal optimist that I, David I would ask you assuming that we do have a buyout what do you think would happen if there was no program afterwards I think in my county and Eastern Kentucky would wouldn't be producing to back up because we're our ground is hilly like I said in my opening statement that we're not as efficient or able to make the man of pants that at the our soul is clay soil and, we can't produce like some of the Western Kentucky States and other parts where they have the real good soul and I think what would happen is the companies would move the production to the other places and Owen County especially in all Eastern Kentucky would be devastated with loss of the income in our communities and besides of the jobs that would have to be found for all people in those communities so it's very important that we have this Geographic, action f you will and a program afterwards site and it is it sure is one of the other things that my colleague mr. Boehner	 he still here I thought okay but you know in I heard what he had to say and obviously there's a lot of Truth in what he has to say but in my mind I don't see any other way to pay for this program except for the consumer to pay for it what I'd like to do is I mean certainly you know the federal government

we're running a 455 billion dollar deficit and financing the war in Iraq and other	 places we're certainly not going to look to the federal government to bail us out and I don't see any other way except for this user fee that's going to would need to be there for a buyout I'd like to open this up to any of you as to what you feel and think about that	 they would you want to start and others as well well I don't see any other way and the only other thing I'd like to say about that when the estimated cost on the master settlement agreement was around 25 to 28 cents and they raised the price of the cigarette 45 cents a pact worded the other goal and guess I'm sure that the charging the consumer for but we have been a no net cost program we haven't been a cost to the	 government in since we were started in years ago and I guess I think it would be a burden somewhat of a burden to the smoker but I don't see any other way anybody else have a comment in there now I think you're exactly right it would be probably insane for us to ask for it to be paid by taxpayers at this point in time I think that the industry has shown a remarkable ability to generate the income necessary to pay the debt owed by the master settlement agreement	 Aunt it's the amount of money that would be required to do a federal quota by out with this fairly insignificant in relation to the 206 billion dollar settlement this currently being paid by the the higher prices of cigarettes another couple of key factors that are important to bring out on paying for this is that there is some self-financing involved in fact and because purchasers of tobacco and you else will buy the value as Tobacco For Less money they will	 I have to expand much less money than what they are right now in order to purchase us tobacco and also as the side agreement Phase 2 has been Unearthed alluded to earlier that's no longer an obligation if there is a quota by out and that money's already been earmarked by those folks who are paying it and it could be transferred into a potential coat of biota soil I see my time is up I was hoping it before you folks leave that there's an open Period where any of you might be able to cover anything in a few	 comments that you might have that hasn't been covered because I think this is very valuable to us all hope you get that opportunity thank you I thank the gentleman for his contribution and he was he was wondering where other than the consumers to get the money I'm wondering how much of the 206 billion-dollar Master settlement was paid in attorneys fees in a multi multi billions of dollars that might have been better spent compensating Farmers for that will the gentleman yield	 I would definitely yield you know I be happy to support a bill today that took 19 billion dollars from The Trial Lawyers and give it to the tobacco farmers and art call for the vote now we're starting to see consensus develop here the gentleman from North Carolina mr. Hayes	 thank you mr. chairman I appreciate you having us here in and gentlemen I appreciate you being here and all you do I want to publicly thank the judge Bill Jenkins for his effort trying to put this together a strong United voice which we have in our producers is critically important you've touched on this issue and my good friend mr. Lucas asked a good question I might simply amplify his question by saying no matter how we pay for the consumer is going to be painful one way	 and figure out which pocket to take it out of but in a post by out environment what program programs if any do you see as being a part of Tobacco post by out if you just go down the table and anybody that has a comment would be appreciate some of the comments today have related to the fact that we're probably going to have FDA	 regulation and and I understand we say that is not going to be at the farm level but in some shape or form it's going to trickle down to us if the a Regulators may not be out there on the farm but we are going to be held to some standard I think if we have FDA regulation of tobacco so I think you know if we're going to deal with those regulations that we should also be able to have some Safeguard as too	 knowing that that we could produce it and maybe expect a higher price	 where's Carter you're almost in the eighth District thanks for being used to be in your District Congressman I regret that I was redistricting but that's another issues but I think that the current program as it exists has been as I alluded to in my testimony the gold standard for a long time it's offered a lot of stability and the in the rural communities of North Carolina unfortunately in the last 15 years that stabilized us 6 inches underwater and we're drowning and it doesn't matter if we're	 Abel are six inches underwater to foot under water or for floating on the bottom we're still in the same situation and I think that there's a lot of issues to really be afraid of to have a lot of trepidation about and what they actually a being one of them and I think that Growers are in a desperate enough situation that we have considered all the Alternatives there's not an opportunity to fix what we got and we need to do something different as a minimum we need	 to have the safety net similar to what's available to other farm programs and commodities and we need to try to toward lies in order to maintain our rural communities keep the back and grown and areas similar to where it is now now I agree with two gentlemen for me the one other concern I have we've got to remember our communities because when FDA comes down and cost will trickle down like the save but we've got to remember if we lose all control	 old and tobacco moves away from our communities but we're going to be devastating	 I think one of the concerns would be some some type of crop insurance the availability to carry it because still with the Aloha hope your friend is taken out the back is still a very high value crop still have to invest a lot of money still means borrowing money and like in Virginia I'm sure some of you familiar would happen with the peanut program value of peanuts oh LOL and what the actual break-even cost is and bankers are kind of leery by lending money on a	 proposition even though they might have enough to offset it somewhere else so I think crop insurance would be a big	 post by out we'd like to see a safety net that really reflects the cost of production post by out mr. Congressman seems like would be fired as simple type of thing to issue a license to those individuals who are currently producing to back up now based on buying intentions of companies that thing would have to be prorated	 I did but that poundage amount of FICA would remain in each locality each County whether it be in Virginia North Carolina Tennessee where ever and can be prorated out to these folks who are currently producing and I don't think it would be any big deal I think all that are producing tobacco would be now currently producing would be	 happy with something like this it would keep it in the communities as these folks before me have said you know and we've got to look at that economic impact of what the bike actually does to these small communities across	 whatever area were talking about thanks sir mr. chairman I ask unanimous consent to place my written statement in the record in to make one for the comment mr. Lucas and the consumer and mr. Boehner we got a chance here to put an effort together every time a personal injury lawyer filed a suit against it the back of folks we ought to get a fee and if they ever win one I hope they don't another fee and we could raise money in a hurry well gentlemen is observation is correct in my statement will be made a part of the record	 and they the folks you referred to already have gotten one whopping big fee from the master settlement	 they gentleman from Tennessee mr. Davis recognized for five minutes thank you mr. chairman and ranking member and my colleague Bill Jenkins from Tennessee it's going to see a Tennessee in here as well as many of the other folks here from the south	 I can recall as a youngster growing up the first time I remember tobacco	 and I'll be 60 years old at my birthday so for that length of time has been to back up on the farm where my father lived and word my brother still produces its laid by note that terminology means laid by weight and Burly okay stop it in the basically cut it in our students into the tobacco barns which we now use to blow our houses of basically got a point where that we can no longer get Contract but frankly to grow Broiler chickens	 I recall in my early years of studying in school that to product said as always been a part of of America's history Maize corn and tobacco the first Americans the first folks who came here from Europe found Americans growing tobacco and they found corn ben groans you're both have been a major part of agriculture in both the pennebaker part of the economy and the growth of America	 we're seeing corn still there obviously but tobacco has come on hard times and sometimes with contempt from those especially those who may use or consume tobacco are farmers today in Tennessee and across the South	 our I think in a quagmire of deciding where you go because I remember the trips to Dean Planters mr. Jenkins over in Knoxville that's where we sold our Tobacco on the back of a pickup truck and carried over there and it wasn't 20 to 30 Acres it was a sometimes as much as ours was a half an acre which was a pretty sizable problem in Fentress County where I grew up most people had two tenths or 1/10 or maybe just a few hundreds	 they provided the payment for that farm they provide an opportunity for children to get clothing in november-december one that crop was so so as we talk about the tobacco by out I think a lot of folks have already gone out the tobacco business because the difficulty of actually raising tobacco and the uncertainty in the last eight or ten years of of having a continuity of knowing that	 crop will always be as it has been a major part of America's economy	 it also is a major part of our tax base in this country I just looked at some of the figures mom to go and I think some in one of the	 testimony will be heard probably later indicates that there must be somewhere close to	 35 to 40 billion dollars a year in taxes collected on the back of both state and federal and we're talking about over a five-year period 20 billion dollars the consumers obviously pay that we've reached the point where we don't do something or tobacco farmers will not have a program nor will they be producing tobacco as a youngster growing up we grew tobacco and strawberries there was an ice cream company that bought the strawberries from the Cumberland plateau	 recent had a good taste to it and the strawberries put in that ice cream folks wanted that ice cream	 the move to Mexico and in the mid 50's or late 50s week with growing strawberries for reason and tobacco crop is in the same situation today unless I think we're going to lose it any money and it's not right to the American Farmer who for over 200 some odd years has been producing a major part of America's economy	 to lose this product with that at least some reimbursement for the work that you've done tobacco warehouses are bat deceased existing	 my brother and I took tobacco in December and in January 22 a Kentucky Tobacco Warehouse and sold it on the auction block and watched it sell that too has been a part of the history of many of us but the back of while we're at warehouses are becoming fewer and fewer and fewer and the place to actually sell the product are our crop is about to administer with it is no longer viable so I guess I give this testimony in support of and certainly	 in hopes of that tobacco farmer in America from those who don't know what the back is about and the difficulty that you know of producing it that there will be some consensus and some sensitivity to those farmers and are areas that have really been a major part of history and a major part of our economy	 I could ask several questions all of already been asked and just applaud you for being here and for your testimony that you've given and for the for the meaningful part of America that are tobacco Farmers have been I see my times of thank you mr. chairman	 I thank the gentleman	 the gentleman from North Carolina mr. balance	 thank you mr. chairman and	 gentlemen Farmers on the panel thank you for your presence here today and for your testimony	 there is a like my colleague from Tennessee there was a story that I could tell about a growing up on a farm and Rural eastern North Carolina and my mom still lives here Dad brought back my father had to leave the farm and go to New York	 get a job but later he came back and her one of you talk about getting into the Purdue chicken than this	 and because of his work ethic	 did retired but didn't want to sit around so he got into the Purdue chicken business	 but i-i've been very moved by your testimony and them I've talked to many farmers in my district	 tobacco farmers who are suffering	 as I know some of you are and I've heard a lot of the questions and I'm not going to try and ask but I am interested in knowing mr. Carter maybe I'll start with you are there others who are now able to make a living on your farm in addition to yourself yes sir we have a we have a diversified farming operation we grow 200 Acres of flue-cured tobacco and	 almost 150 acres or Fresh Market vegetables we're deeply involved right now and cantaloupe watermelon and tomato Harvest very difficult to be here but I thought was very important to coming after testimony that we've been able to have the privilege to do today I have five full-time employees of those four of them are very important to my farm operation I could not function without them those particular men are unemployable and any other situation we	 have a have annual payroll in excess of 400 thousand dollars that is money is turned over in the local economy this is a very small community that doesn't sound like a lot of money but again I'm going to give those people were only capable of doing Farm labor that's what they've always done they don't have the educational experience to pursue other opportunities and again there's also the issue of this farmers have been displaced which I mentioned earlier again there's there's six gentleman whose Farms Iran	 now who in 1998 where my peers the folks who I used to go and compare crops to we used to talk about how the back of sold now farm near Farms it's like mr. more alluded to earlier in my 32 contracts that I've had to accumulate to try to maintain the size of operation that we have there's over 7	000 acres of land and this combination I'm farming 200 Acres of back on 150 acres of vegetable and that's all that's profitable on this Farm on that farm	 we're in such deep sandal and that commodity prices don't work and heels don't work so it's it's not a large operation in comparison to some and the Midwest but it makes a real impact in my community without going down the road I want to raise this issue I talked to a farmer and Middleburg Carolina mentioned that he had nine both bonds and the only needed about three now	 and he had 78 tractors and all need a couple interview involved in that situation and no other farmers who have excess equipment and barns	 that you can speak of well in my community in burglar production course we're using that equipment to the equipment except for the explicit tobacco equipment for other Commodities or hey in their tractors and stuff for the hay and four feet for the cattle and taking care of them but yes there are several barns Big Barn sitting empty and they're converting them now to Hay storage with this phase one money to store their hay in and save it for the kettle with diversifying into better care	 cattle handling operations and things like that	 I don't know how to microphone but in answer to your question on our farm we use 25 curing facilities to cure our tobacco those Farms that I have rented since 1998 are 75 Barnes there are sitting idle	 I want to raise this is just one more issue generally speaking and anybody can respond what is the most of us the style jerk and course in this room you have told support and I want to make sure the record is clear that I support the buyout what is the feeling of your downtown Neighbors	 do they support the buyout the think that you all on your own how's that	 I think most of the communities around home they understand because like I mentioned with the factories in the textiles it's no employment we have high unemployment to start with them with the decreasing quota at scoffs sales that's fertilized the sales that's everything sales is decreased that much and I think a lot of the	 sentiment is you know whatever happens here is because like mr. Carter said I land is suitable for the Bible yes we raise some crops but no large degree we can graze cattle but you it's hard to stay on the farm it doesn't generate a lot of income and nobody that you can employ anybody because it's not enough income there for other employment so it is they understand that the predicament we are in in the communities of suffering as well	 mr. chairman one of the things that we know is that	 as members of Congress we end in a minority in terms of representing Farmers a lot of our colleagues come from areas where they don't growth back and won the reason I raise that question we're going to need to make sure that they are on board if we're gonna get this buyout and	 I want to just pledge my support again for this buyout and I work as hard as I can for thank you very much mr. chairman I thank the gentleman I understand the gentleman from Alabama mr. Rogers does not have any questions so we will at this time thank this panel for your contribution to this very difficult subject it is very helpful to have the benefit of the use of the people who write on the ground and who are suffering through this difficult	 economic time that is not getting any better for tobacco Farmers I thank you all very much for your contribution at this time we will invite our third panels of the table mr. Brennan Dawson vice president for external Affairs of Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company of Louisville Kentucky	 mr. Everett ye the third general counsel of S&M Brands Incorporated of Keysville Virginia mr. Tommy Paine Executive Vice President of external relations for RJ Reynolds tobacco Holdings Incorporated of Winston-Salem North Carolina mr. Norman sharp president of the cigar Association of America of Washington d.c. mr. Mike Szymanski	 Brett chairman and CEO of Philip Morris USA of New York New York mr. Ashley Taylor Junior legal counsel for the Council of independent tobacco manufacturers of America of Richmond Virginia mr. Steve Watson vice president of external Affairs to the lorillard Tobacco Company of Greensboro North Carolina	 you want to set it up here too I'd like to welcome all the members of this panel thank you for your participation day remind you that your full statement will be made a part of the record and ask given the large number of witnesses that	 you limit your remarks to five minutes I'll begin by correcting myself and noting that is Miss Brennan Dawson and I miss Dawson we are very pleased to have you with us today thank you mr. chairman and members of the committee my name is Branden Dawson I'm from Brown & Williamson tobacco Corporation I'm very happy to be here today to talk about the potential grower by out at Brown & Williamson we swing about twice our size in terms of how much you asleep we buy because we're part of a worldwide group of companies we actually buy	 here in the us for the rest of the world so what we're ten percent of the market share here we by about 20% or double our size in u.s. leaf	 tobacco Growers like the rest of the tobacco industry have had several very difficult years recently and it would be impossible for us to miss that the tobacco growers in the United States both flue-cured Ian Burley really want this tobacco by out we'd be happy to support it Tobacco by out but it has to be fairly funded it has to be forward-looking and we think FDA has absolutely no role in this in this issue when we talk about the grower by out there	 is to be kind of some sort of false expectation that this is really just a matter of sending a Big Bill to the tobacco companies and moving on it's nothing like that the marketplace for us manufacturers is very very challenging right now and that's part of the reason that the Growers are having such difficulties this isn't about litigation or legislation this is about a price War that's going on in the United States right now when we signed them all to the master settlement agreement we took on a huge	 huge burden about 55 cents a pack that gets passed along to Consumers when we raised our prices that made room for a whole new group of entrance new companies to come into the US market these are people who compete on price and price alone some consumers walk into a market and they say give me the cheapest pack of smokes you have those companies started out representing two percent of cigarettes sold in the United States they now represent 13% we've had to	 lower our prices take it out of our bottom lines just to stay competitive in the US market so we are not rolling or flush in cash that would make the payments for this grow or by out adding to all of this is a hugely exploding tax that goes directly to our consumers right now 46 percent of the price of a pack of cigarettes is taken directly by state and federal governments it adds up to about 120 million dollars a day	 there is enough tobacco tax money to go around right now we believe it's a matter of priorities and it's a matter of looking at what's already existing and taking from from that pot rather than making the situation worse by coming back to us and asking us to pay a bill that we simply find it impossible to do	 what's left if there's a buyout we think there should be a free market if Growers are bought out a free market would allow them to reduce their prices and be competitive on the World Market which is one of the main reasons that they're seeing their quotas cut cut	 but if there needs to be licensing or production controls we have to be careful this is the forward-looking part not to put something back in place that replicates the problems that keep us Farmers from being competitive now and that's the artificially Empresa artificially inflated price that us Leaf Now commands my company can go to Brazil and buy tobacco for 40 cents on the dollar we don't do that all the time we buy as much us as we can	 but that's who the farmers are competing against and we have to make them competitive finally FDA the Food and Drug Administration it is said is necessary to make this politically possible that's not the case we believe these are two very separate issues	 if you look at the Food and Drug Administration proposals that are currently on the table we would find them unsustainable we find them unsustainable we won't buy tobacco we won't be here to do it that in and of itself ought to separate these two issues	 we have to look at what sort of regulatory regime we want for tobacco I believe separately because it's not an easy issue there is room to have debate on what sort of regulations we should have additional regulations we should have going forward but that's not going to help but tobacco by out because the proposals that are currently on the table give the federal the the FDA virtually you know wholesale regulatory authority over our products in fact they could come in and	 tell us how to make them and we would have to translate that down to Farmers and it's not something that we believe we can sustain so again thank you very much mr. chairman for this opportunity thank you for the attention the committee has has paid to these complicated issues and we look forward to working with each of the members as we move forward thank you Miss Dawson for that valuable contribution mr. am I pronounce your name is Iggy orgy it's GE GE I apologize it's okay Gog welcome thank you mr. chairman and members	 of the committee my name is Everett G general counsel for SM Brands Inc and I guess we're very happy to have a seat at this table because you would call a small tobacco my family lives in Southern Virginia and Congressman Goods district and for five generations we have been farming tobacco and Southern Virginia and continue to do so today therefore being a small manufacturer and tobacco Farmers I think we provide a unique perspective because we wear two hats in addressing this committee and it's going to be	 of a cult some time for me to separate my manufacturer hat from my Farmer hat so I'll try to keep the two separate although we hope that something that could become too by this committee and by the Congress that would be acceptable off to all parties we started our company in 1994 and indeed there has been a lot of changes in the industry both as a farmer with all the quota buyouts we've heard today	 eight we were not sued we were so new and we are not a member but one thing I want to leave the committee with today is all small tobacco or not importers and there are problems in the industry now that we feel primarily are lying at the feet of the importers under the master settlement agreement to those of us who are not signatories we are required to Escrow effectively equivalent monies and to me even more injuriously no one has agreed at the IRS	 those monies should be tax deductible as the majors Ms a settlement payments are so it is a cost built into the MSA to small manufacturers from the very beginning that gets me to a buyout issue on the farmer side maybe the farmer hat speaking here but absolutely we support assistance to the tobacco Farmers the issue is which would that look like and who should funded from a small tobacco's perspective we have no problem	 mmm if the payment schedule is Equitable and fair and what I mean by that if big companies pay five cents a pack and medium companies pay fast in a pack the little guys would like to pay five cents a pack as well that's all we would ask in any buyout scenario we've heard rumors of credits here and there may be more on the Senate side but we certainly do not have the resources to compete with the major manufacturers if there is a disparity in the amount of money put	 small tobacco and that's not even in the money issue if there are other regulations that come out of Congress that are directed at small tobacco we would be certainly against that because it's a tough enough industry as well being squeezed on one end by the majors who have some fine products and worse on the other end by importers who are not paying with their supposed to be paying and are selling on price alone and we want to point out to you that our Bailey's Flagship product I'm a member of the Bailey's Family my mother married man	 Mike Bailey being tobacco Farmers we have pride in u.s. tobacco and it's the best in the world so in our Bailey's product we put 100% u.s. flew in Burley tobacco's in there one of the reasons we founded our company was to support the tobacco farmers and the tobacco Farmers have supported us where in our rural agricultural area of Southern Virginia and we have lost jobs as you've heard here our company currently employs 200 which is a big employer in our area and are only antennas to being treated fairly to	 out the farmers but to be able to maintain and hopefully grow a little bit our business so we could continue to give good jobs to folks in our rural communities there are other small us manufacturers in America and we are asked that the treatment of those people be the fare as well on the FDA issue I think I'm in complete agreement with Miss Dawson and I'm afraid the farmers maybe under estimating the devastating impact that FDA can have once you let that Genie out of the bottle	 it's going to really depend on the devil in the details of The Regulators in charge at any particular time and if there are any tobacco it just seems ironic to me to take a bill where we want to help the farmer in a buyout but have to hook something to it that in the long-term could destroy the farmer because if the FDA regulations are so harsh as to punish companies the companies are the ones buying the domestic tobacco so we're taken with one hand while trying to give what the other and that just doesn't seem to make a whole lot of common sense here to me	 and I don't know how this Congress could keep reasonable FDA regulation whatever that means to keep the FDA from taking out natural constituencies know kind of constituents found in tobacco so from our standpoint we just ask to be treated fairly and equitably and we certainly do not think that FTA is a good idea for the industry or for our Farmers thank you	 thank you mr. G mr. Payne welcome thank you good afternoon	 appreciate the appear on the opportunity to appear and ask that my written statement be made part of the record	 the one constant in any review or discussion of a bio is lack of consensus not only on the general idea of but also the specifics of any legislative proposal	 this overall lack of consensus has been persistent since the Clinton Tobacco Commission suggested in eight and four by out couple with broad regulatory FDA Authority now there are differing opinions on a whole range of important issues and many of her many of them you've already listened to this morning but the appropriate base year amount of payment per pound who actually receives the payment the viability of the price support program and in position and impact of additional Federal	 a most notably there is lack of consensus on how to fund a multibillion-dollar by how particularly at a time when you have record federal and state budget deficits and you have a much change Financial Dynamic among the major manufacturers	 R gr has not taken a formal position as to whether a buyout should be adopted however we have repeatedly stated that we have three major concerns first the actual mechanism for funding the buyout secondly	 combining a buyout with anti-competitive Federal Regulation and finally the competitiveness of tobacco Growers who we want to remain in the business now my written testimony details the areas that I've just covered I want to focus briefly today to talk about the funding issue	 last week in an article in the Southeast Farm press the president of flue-cured stabilization Co-op Bruce fly was quoted as saying it's a it comes down to one thing we support getting the money	 now there's no doubt that when you proposed to hand out billions of dollars but you're going to tend to get a lot of supporters regardless of the viability or the consequences of that proposal financial position of the industry has changed significantly over the last four years the signing the 1998 when the majors signed the state settlements and also over the last couple of years because of the enormous increase in state excise taxes to pay for their deficits	 simply put there are really only two groups in the tobacco business that are legitimately finding their way or adequately finding their way to the bank these days the first one is a government both federal and state having making more off each pack of cigarettes by many foal than anyone else in the business and the second one or the low-end manufacturers who not only don't make settlement payments they do make Phase 2 payments and they get rebates on their escrow payments to the states	 it's critical to recognize this change Financial dynamic	 as you decide whether or how to fund a buyout in fact it's imperative I think that you recognize it so that you understand	 the simplistic Notions or suggestions that are made that we simply raise our price per pack a couple of cents and you understand what implications those actually have the reason for the change Dynamic is pretty simple	 the price increases at the measures of had to take in order to pay for the state settlements and also the state excise taxes have caused us in a very short period of time to Toulouse very significant amount of volume market share and obviously as a result of that had significant decreases in our earnings at the same time the volume of the low-end manufacturers who don't make the settlement payments has grown enormously over a thousand percent in just the last four years	 1998 they produce two billion cigarettes annually in 2002 that was over 28 billion cigarettes and as mr. G noted some of those are importers importers have seen their volumes increased from 4 billion sticks cigarettes in nineteen ninety nine to eighteen point seven billion cigarettes in 2002	 let me just give you a quick example of the impact of funding in our Jr provides a good example	 we told the street this year our investors in the street that we projected having operating income earnings of 500 million dollars now one of the bills that's introduced in the house and the staff did a budget analysis of it for the first year the total cost of the buyout for the industry would be two point 1 billion dollars of that amount or Jr would be mandated to pay 400 million dollars so in other words 4/5 of our operating income	 income that we've told Wall Street and our investors will learn this year will be mandated to pay for the biome	 now get my written testimony goes into more detail on this and other issues and again chairman I appreciate the opportunity to be here today thank you mr. Payne mr. sharp welcome	 mr. chairman and members of the committee my name is Norman sharp and I'm president of the cigar Association of America and the pipe tobacco Council the CAA is the national Trade Organization of domestic and foreign cigar manufacturers importers Leaf dealers and other major suppliers to the industry the cigar industry has annual sales of about 2 billion dollars the pipe tobacco Council consists of Manufacturers and importers of pipe tobacco representing about 98% of the pipe tobacco sold in the United States we estimate	 annual retail sales of pipe tobacco to be 150 million dollars pipe tobacco sales in the United States have declined 90 percent in the last 30 years while I appreciate the opportunity to testify we cannot understand how the cigar and pipe tobacco Industries came to be included in the pending by out bills and we certainly cannot fathom from where the numbers in these bills came first both hr:140 and HR 245 are extremely unfair to the pipe and cigar manufacturer Industries	 unlike the cigarette companies the cigar and pipe tobacco industry's use little to no domestic quota tobacco or imported quota type tobacco in fact our use of quota tobacco so minimal that the USDA doesn't even bother asking our Industries for their purchase intentions it makes no sense to require our Industries to pay taxes for the buyout of a system in which we do not participate and from which we derive no benefits indeed we believe that the amount of quota to	 but we use a similar to that used by the medical research programs should they be included as a funding source despite this minimal use these bills proposed to hit our combined Industries with over 165 million dollars a year and increased taxes and amount that may well exceed the net profit after taxes of the domestic cigar or pipe tobacco industry's second what we do not concede that any bio taxes would be rational under these bills are in a series would be forced to	 shoot at an amount far out of proportion to our share of the overall tobacco industry however it might be measured based on total revenues total taxes paid total tobacco used You Name It We were being taxed at a punitive rate mr. chairman cigarette sales make up roughly 97.5 percent of domestic tobacco sales but the cigarette industry would pay only about 92 percent of total user fees the irony of the cigar and pipe tobacco industry's subsidizing the cigarette industry	 striking and dead third the imposition of a user fee on the cigar and pipe tobacco industry's is a logical and appropriate and possibly unconstitutional because we use virtually no quota tobacco I know the committee would prefer to consider bile legislation independent of the Ways and Means Committee however user fees require a benefit to or at least a Nexus with the user there's no such link between cigar manufacturers and quota tobacco the pending bio bills would impose new excise taxes on	 my members pure and simple finally the FDA regulation that would be at the inevitable result of this buyout effort makes no sense for the cigar and pipe tobacco industry's the proponents of FDA Authority base their arguments on the need to reduce youth usage of tobacco products yet there is virtually no youth issue for the cigar industry nor for the pipe tobacco industry whose typical consumers over 50 the FDA recognizes this fact when it released its final rule regulating certain tobacco products in 1996	 and that rule the FDA specifically chose not to regulate cigar and pipe tobacco products most importantly because it found no credible evidence that children and adolescents use these products to any significant degree additionally our Industries do relatively little advertising and promotion of our products in 2001 we spent less than 45 million dollars compared to the 11 billion dollars spent by the cigarette industry our products do not lend themselves to the type of testing and	 control regulations proposed by the FDA bills pending in Congress cigars unlike cigarettes are not uniformly manufactured indeed there are over 2	400 different sizes shapes and brands of cigars being sold in the United States similarly pipe tobacco has produced in many types of Blends and the use of pipe tobacco is highly individualized depending on pipe shape composition and the manner of filling by the user	 in conclusion the cigar and pipe tobacco industries use virtually no quota tobacco and should not be included as a funding source in any by owed Bill indeed including as a funding source would amount to imposing huge new excise taxes on our Industries which is beyond the authority of this committee authority of Over Our Industries has not been sought by the FDA and is an appropriate given the unique characteristics of our Industries and the absence of Youth usage of our products which is normally the motivating factor	 and granting the FDA authority over the tobacco industry mr. chairman our experience in history as well of are not as well as our knowledge of our consumers convinces us that the taxes of an amount even approaching this magnitude would decimate those Industries the imposition of these taxes and FDA regulation would be tantamount to forcing us out of business thank you for this opportunity to testify before you thank you mr. sharp Mister semantics we are very pleased to have you with us	 and thank you welcome your testimony I'm delighted to be here mr. chairman and members of the committee I'm like Symantec chairman and CEO of Philip Morris USA I'm very proud that Philip Morris USA is here today I believe is the only Tobacco Company supporting tobacco quota by out that is politically feasible because it is funded by a realistic Revenue source and includes FDA oversight of tobacco products we believe that these two important goals are inextricably linked	 hr:140 introduced by congressman's McIntyre and Davis would establish a strong Market oriented fully sustainable alternative to the current federal tobacco program it would also provide for Meaningful and effective regulation of tobacco products by the FDA the convergence of Federal Regulation and the tobacco quota by out presents an opportunity to work together to ensure that these complementary goals are joined to	 fashion a comprehensive effective National tobacco policy in our judgment hr:140 is the only plan currently on the table that has a chance of actually being implemented and of providing the concrete by out payments that the growing Community wants there are three principal reasons for this first hr:140 is fully funded by a realistic Revenue Source by our proposals with no funding source or proposals that are	 too expensive simply won't get past second hr:140 proposes a quota by out that truly is a buyout and that merely a subsidy posing as one alternative proposals that purport to eliminate the existing quota and price support system only to replace them with new ones or simply not reasonable or achievable there are also counterproductive if a post by out Marketplace includes subsidies that artificially inflate the cost of US tobacco	 there will be a very strong financial disincentive for manufacturers to buy it new subsidies also rate queries questions both the fairness to Farmers of other crops and of our nation's agreement to observe the Caps imposed by the World Trade Organization these caps if exceeded would result in reduced commodity support payments for All American farmers finally hr:140 links the buyout to meaningful and effective regulation by the	 yay to both reduce harm caused by tobacco products and to keep FDA Personnel off the farm there are strong supporters of both the buyout and FDA regulation and by joining forces we believe that they can forge a majority we're convinced that time is slipping away rapidly and that all parties must come together now in support of a plan that occupies the political Center and that a majority in both the house	 and the Senate can accept on every key issue hr:140 occupies the middle ground of the debate	 for example HR 245 a bill that has been introduced is a thoughtful effort to approach some of these important issues but elements such as its 19 billion dollar price tag of already drawn some criticism from observers such as the Louisville Courier-Journal which described it as way to Luxurious to stand much of a chance hr:140 Falls halfway between this well-intentioned effort and to twelve to thirteen billion dollars	 is being currently discussed in the Senate hr:140 also offers a compromise and the issue of safety net which is clearly crafted so as not to trigger WTO caps and hr:140 contains comprehensive effective FDA regulation of tobacco that is not so radical that it would result in prohibition or other serious unintended consequences mr. chairman I am not here today to insist that it must be McIntyre Davis	 or nothing however I do believe that the only legislation containing the fundamental principles of hr:140 crafted in light of today's political and economic realities as a realistic possibility of enactment it seems to me that nobody can get everything that they want in this process and that only a bill that makes reasonable compromises can be signed into law we understand that there are complex and controversial issues in both	 this legislation and we pledge to work with anyone who wishes to join in this challenge mr. chairman we commend you and your committee for these hearings is another critical step in the process thank you very much thank you mr. semantics mr. Taylor welcome	 thank you good afternoon mr. chairman and members of the committee I'm Ashley Taylor and I serve as legal counsel to the Council of independent tobacco manufacturers of America a national trade Association better known as Sigma thank you for allowing me the opportunity to testify before you today sit must consist of more than a dozen small tobacco manufacturers that have elected not to become signatories to the master settlement agreement between the major tobacco manufacturers and the state attorney	 General such as SM Ram as non-signatories to the MSA sit members are required under state law enacted as part of the MSA to make certain escrow deposit based upon the number of sticks old and MSA States to become a cinema member a tobacco manufacturer must not only be duly authorized to conduct business in the United States"
