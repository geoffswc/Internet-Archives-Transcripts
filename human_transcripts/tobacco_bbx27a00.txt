The Vineyards and in the issues of advertising and and this whole issue of public information and we're very very fortunate to have you here I want to if you would to dr. bloom I'm going to yield a send a durenberger who has another committee meeting at the present time and has individual who be coming up after after you but he's going to necessarily have to absent himself,I'd like to call on him now whether he had introduced the Commissioner of Health Minnesota Department of Health and we'll include that introduction to the appropriate place in the record chairman thank you very much I appreciate your doing this we do have a hearing on underground storage tanks and your mention of Allan Bloom is a work, listen to the testimony of previous Witnesses, late again to see Senator Dodd with whom I had the privilege of serving in the house number of years ago, we would just like to offer our complete statement for the record we understand the it'll be received and we've been asked to summarize I'd like to mention the fact that I have with me Mr. Floyd Abrams who is leading expert in the Constitutional aspects of advertising he's taught First Amendment law at Yale and Columbia Law school's and at the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism and I think mr. Abrams has argued more cases before, the US Supreme Court involved in freedom of the press and any lawyer in American history is widely published we had hoped that he would have an opportunity to testify we've been told that due to the pressure of time that won't be possible but he's with me today he has submitted a statement for the record and we hope that it'll be you'll be afforded an opportunity to respond to questions specifically on the subject of advertising, Mr. Chairman, Dr. Sullivan's statement was long and eloquent but his bottom line was that he does not see a need for the legislation that is the subject of this hearing today and one of the reasons for that was all of the things that are already in place nobody opposes education, but the american public including youngsters already educated to the perceived health hazards of smoking a despite what a number of witnesses have said here this morning independent survey research including that originated by HHS in 1985 demonstrates that not only have 98 percent of Americans heard that smoking is a health threat 95 percent believed it increases the risk of lung, cancer 92% believed it increases the risk of emphysema and 91% believed it increased the risk of heart disease and Mr. Chairman instead of changing warning labels letting the states tamper with National Standard advertising policy requiring long list of ingredients to be provided a bureaucrats in the public creating a new bureaucracy and spending hundreds of millions of dollars of public funds badly, needed for hundreds of other critical purposes consider the programs already in place they include as Dr. Sullivan mentioned this morning their office of smoking and health established pursuant to the smoking and health Act of 1984 Dr. Sullivan I believe said that that office is very active and intends to remain active and even to increase its level of activity you have I think you held it up there this morning Mr. chairman the list of ingredients in cigarettes already been provided to HHS is required by the same act and let me save Mr. chairman and the industry and the individual companies have submitted five separate lists of ingredients there has been communication back and forth between the office of smoking and health and the secretary's office and the companies over this time with specific questions about those ingredients Dr. Sullivan said this morning that recently the department had decided that it needed quantitative information, about ingredients they wrote a representative of the industry last week and two days later the industry responded I don't suppose that secretary had seen that this morning indicated that he had not but two days later the industry responded that that quantitative information would be forthcoming and offered again to work and cooperate with the secretary to the degree that he felt was necessary to make any sensual determinations about ingredients, and the secretary is already mandated by the smoking and health Act of 1984 to report to Congress whatever findings and recommendations he feels unnecessary in connection with ingredients or further disclosure of ingredients or additions or deletions of ingredients so that's already going on in the case of nicotine tar and carbon monoxide there's a laboratory which is owned and operated by the tobacco institute but which is monitored on a daily basis by the Federal Trade Commission that uses a method approved by the Federal Trade Commission to test that tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide that information is already available to FTC an annual list is published showing what brands contain what levels of tar and nicotine and tobacco cigarette advertisement this country is required to show the tar and nicotine content so that's, already being taken care of their laws and regulations all the way from the some of those we mentioned and others from the national government to small municipalities and I think anybody would be struck this morning and listening to what's going on you mentioned Mr. chairman activities in Boston in Massachusetts New England intensive state and local effort doing additional regulatory work and increasing the level of regulation of cigarette smoking, to do in Bergen sister Ashton and others mentioned Minnesota and the Midwest Senator hatch mentioned his area you and others even mentioned States like Virginia and North Carolina which have tobacco States so we don't believe that has been demonstrated a great need to provide money to states to step up their level of activity they already have an extremely high level of activity and his sister Ashton speaking for all Association of state governments indicated that level, is increasing all the time, in addition to that we have the annual reports by the Surgeon General on smoking and health and is a brand new report that we saw for the first time when we walked in this morning these annual reports not only recite to extensive Summers of epidemiological studies but consistently and deliberately draw very dire conclusions from these studies and they seemed to grow more surreal every year and these are highly publicized by the media and elsewhere, then their extensive highly publicized well organized and will  financed anti-smoking campaigns in the private sector we're familiar with those with mentioned this morning the Great American smokeout which is an annual events perfect example many of us and all the major news media very quick to give extensive coverage to anti-smoking laws and anti-smoking campaigns and health claims no matter how reasonable unreasonable they may be but you might raise a question Senator well if these things are going on, they're not working they're not accomplishing the desired result well let's point out a few results that have been accomplished the prevalence of smoking by adults since 1965 according to the surgeon general's report has dropped from 40% to 29% one out of every two Americans who smoke has quit between 1965 and 1985 41 million Americans quit smoking 90% of those, Mr. chairman alone without any outside help this is according to the surgeon general's own report 1988 this certainly doesn't sound like tobacco has the same addictive qualities as heroin and cocaine when half the people who ever smoked have quit certainly you can't say that about habitual users of hard drugs by 1985 the group of ex-smokers in this country outnumbered people who smoked more than 25 cigarettes a day by three-to-one margin that comes from the 1988 United States Statistical Abstract concerns been expressed about young people the prevalence of daily smoking among high school students drop from 29 percent to 21 percent between 1976 and 1980 and has fluctuated between 18 and 21 percent since that time and Mr. chairman as far back as 1979 the Surgeon General said in his report on smoking and health by the time they reach the seventh grade the vast majority, of children believe not have heard but believe that smoking is dangerous to one's Health that's a direct quote as recently as 1987 a survey reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that of 895 Children and adolescents questioned over 98 percent said they believed smoking is harmful and this again is a direct quote accurately named one or more body parts that are adversely affected by smoking, in short Americans young and old in all sectors and in all socio-economic groups has been educated to the alleged health risks of smoking and a sizable majority has elected to stop smoking or not to start others have chosen to assume whatever risk exists just as many Americans knowingly assume other risks that are a part of their chosen lifestyle let me talk just a minute to Mr. chairman about advertising it's, been an allegation after allegation here that we've heard over and over from the anti-tobacco forces that the cigarette industry advertising is with the deliberate purpose in mind of inducing young people and others to begin smoking to in effect expand the market of smokers now let me address that just a minute we have always advertise just like every other industry advertisers particularly for a mature product the product that's been out there, a long time not a brand new product that we try to inform people about for the first time and that is our individual companies which are highly competitive they're probably the most competitive countries companies in the American merchandising Arena today their competition is is very intense and they're out there fighting for market share they're out there fighting to induce people who smoke too, smoke their brand to induce those who already smoked their brand to retain that brand loyalty and that's the purpose of the advertising I want to quote again Dr.Coups report of 1989 this again is a direct quote there is no scientifically rigorous study available to the public that provides a definitive answer to the basic question of where the advertising and promotion increased the level of tobacco consumption this is an admission by the, Surgeon General that there is no significant empirical evidence that advertisers increases the level of consumption, the 1987 report to the president of the Council of economic advisers says this quote there is little evidence that advertising results in additional smoking as with many products advertising mainly shifts consumers among Brands evidence from other countries and this is significant as well M r. chairman suggests that banning tobacco advertising has not Banning advertising has not discouraged smoking, I want a quote now Michael perch chunk the former chairman of the Federal Trade Commission and a leading anti-smoking Advocates and he said this no one pretends that advertising is a major determinant of smoking in this country or any other now those are the facts Mr. chairman as admitted by responsible public officials that advertising does not serve the purpose of increasing the level of smoking but, instead it is the tool by which the company's attempt to retain or gain market share let me say just one other thing on the subject of advertising mr. chairman some of our companies this morning and otherwise have been severely castigated by what's been described as targeted advertising you know you in your bill mr. chairman this committee and your legislation really does the same thing your legislation tries to look and see who it is, who is smoking cigarettes and then Target program to those groups to encourage them not to smoke cigarettes I think every manufactured products sold in this country mature products that are out there if you start to introduce a new model of automobile for example you're going to season you want to compete with the Ford Taurus just to pick something out of the air General Motors is going to compete with it you're going to hire marketing, and you're going to look and find out who it is it's buying the Ford Taurus now and what those people are looking for in a car and then you've got to Target your marketing and your advertising scheme accordingly why should it be any different in the cigarette industry I would remind the chairman and the committee that there is a legitimate Market out there of women who smoke cigarettes is not trying to persuade women who don't smoke to smoke but if you manufacture and sell cigarettes and there's an established Market out there women smokers why is it somehow different for a cigarette manufacturer to Target an existing Market than it is for other companies to Target an existing Market we just fail to understand the difference between our industry which is selling a lawful product on a lawful market and other Industries which are selling the lawful product on a lawful Market mr. chairman this is a long bill, there are a lot of different Provisions in it I'm not going to trespass further on your time I will stop my prepared statement at this time and be glad to respond to questions that you have.
