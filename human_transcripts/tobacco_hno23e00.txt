any kind thank you, good morning and thank you very much for coming John thank you well the verdict in the chip alone case is clearly a victory for the cigarette manufacturer and any effort to characterize it otherwise is a distortion this case was trumpeted by the plaintiffs bar for years and years to be the acid test the cigarette product liability litigation the plaintiffs three law firms are padded and litigated it for five years and took almost all of its 18 weeks of trial duration for the presentation of their case, in doing so they observed no scruple in their effort to defame and to discredit the entire tobacco industry and the three defendant tobacco companies before the jury they failed to do so, not only did they fail to prove their most critical assertion they also failed in their quest of punitive damages and they failed in the face of every possible assistance that they could receive from a court which was demonstrably hostile tobacco companies at the outset and which gave the plaintiff's counsel enormous latitude and consistently preferential rulings many of which, were unwarranted or the customary Rules of Evidence and procedure, this Victory is also important because it sends a message to lawyers and to Plaintiff that jury will not allow them to recap to recap huge financial windfall by suing unreasonable product liability losses and in that sense I urge you to view with skepticism any plane that this verdict is really a victory for the plaintiff and his law firms, the plaintiffs law firms invested by their own admission over two million dollars from their own time and their own money to bring this case to trial and what do they have to show for it, on the narrow and Technical basis of an Express warranty allegedly made by Liggett over 22 years ago the jury awarded a few hundred thousand dollars to miss the trip alone, in light of the jury's other decisions that certainly sounds like an illogical and a curious award and it suggests at least to me that the jury somehow felt some sympathy for Mr. chip alone, that result we are told by Liggett is going to be peeled and we have every confidence that it will be reversed on appeal this is a clear demonstration that those that these cases are just not worth pursuing, and I suspect that the six or so of the plaintiff law firms that are handling the majority of these cases around the country will kick quickly come to the same conclusion, reviewing this case remember that this jury completely exonerated all of the Defenders lorillard Phillip Morris and ligand of the principal charges, one of the companies fraudulently misrepresented and concealed material facts concerning health risks associated with cigarette smoking and two that the company's conspire prior to 1966 to misrepresent for concealed material facts about cigarette smoking and health, or three companies were exonerated of those charges furthermore we have heard much from the plaintiff's counsel and his colleagues throughout this case about the so-called secret company document they were going to reveal and they were going to prove the conspiracy alleged by the point, well it's abundantly clear that the jury completely rejected the distorted and the peace filled piecemeal misrepresentation of those company documents made by plaintiff's counsel when they decided in favor of the companies as I said on the issues of fraud misrepresentation and conspiracy there were no smoking guns among those company patients and that red herring of an issue is now, permenently put to rest, I want to make two more observations and then I'll turn the proceedings over to Mr. bring from Phillip Morris we should all remember that the real story of this litigation it's not a woman from New Jersey to smoke, but about money money about three very big very rich New Jersey Law Firms who decided to invest lots of their own time and their own money in the products liability litigation Lottery, sure they pose the self style champions of Rose chip alone, and yes they panned it too and panned by the whole crew of self-appointed anti-tobacco folks but everyone knows what they were really pursuing, but it wasn't solely to benefit by the rose for Tony AAA, finally the most important result of this case is that on the major issues before the jurors understood the people are still responsible for their own actions and that when something unfortunate happens to them they can't just sue and say someone else's full this jury, those in many other cases before the tobacco industry prior to 1988 have rejected that concept, and they said freedom of choice and personal responsibility still mean something, thank goodness for that it's my pleasure to introduce Marie bring the chief legal officer Phillip Morris, can you spell your name please B r i n g,  just like I said Thank You Arthur and thank you all so so much on behalf of Philip Morris I'd like to welcome you to this press conference he's General Counsel on appeal, i'd like to indicate the beginning that this is a press conference that we had planned before any verdict came in because we were anxious to have this opportunity to set the record straight, we obviously could not do that while the trial was going on despite the fact that there had been many irresponsible charges leveled against Philip Morris and the rest of the industry not only by mystery Dale but by mr. dinard and others who are prominent in the anti-tobacco ranks we were very anxious to have this opportunity to tell our side of the story and in that connection most of you I'm sure received when you came in a memorandum that has been prepared and is available, to any of you who do not have it and it tries to set in context the so-called chip alone documents and it tries to demonstrate as I think is clearly the case that not only Philip Morris but the entire industry has acted responsibly during the past 30 some years since the smoking and health controversy has been raging we're delighted to have this opportunity to set the record straight to tell our side of the story and to answer any questions that you might have concerning any, aspects of this litigation and particularly the documents about which so much has been written in the past four months I noticed in much of the Press today relating to the chip alone verdict that there have been some statements of confusion expressed by not only journalists but by other people who follow this industry and follow the litigation and there seems to be at least prevalent among some the notion that this is a confused verdict it's complicated, it and it's not clear exactly what the verdict means I'd like to take just a minute before we address any questions you might have to try to tell you from Philip Morris's perspective how we view this verdict
