City representing Lorelai and Philip Morris author Stevens will begin the proceedings he will make a statement he will introduce Mary bring will make a statement and then be available for questions of any kind thank you, good morning and thank you very much for coming John thank you well the verdict in the chip alone case is clearly a victory for the cigarette manufacturer and any effort to characterize it otherwise is a distortion this case was trumpeted by the plaintiffs bar for years and years to be the acid test the cigarette product liability litigation the plaintiffs three law firms are padded and litigated it for five years and took almost all of its 18 weeks of trial duration for the presentation of their case, in doing so they observed no scruple in their effort to defame and to discredit the entire tobacco industry and the three defendant tobacco companies before the jury they failed to do so, not only did they fail to prove their most critical assertion they also failed in their quest of punitive damages and they failed in the face of every possible assistance that they could receive from a court which was demonstrably hostile tobacco companies at the outset and which gave the plaintiff's counsel enormous latitude and consistently preferential rulings many of which, were unwarranted or the customary Rules of Evidence and procedure, this Victory is also important because it sends a message to lawyers and to Plaintiff that jury will not allow them to recap to recap huge financial windfall by suing unreasonable product liability losses and in that sense I urge you to view with skepticism any plane that this verdict is really a victory for the plaintiff and his law firms, the plaintiffs law firms invested by their own admission over two million dollars from their own time and their own money to bring this case to trial and what do they have to show for it, on the narrow and Technical basis of an Express warranty allegedly made by Liggett over 22 years ago the jury awarded a few hundred thousand dollars to miss the trip alone, in light of the jury's other decisions that certainly sounds like an illogical and a curious award and it suggests at least to me that the jury somehow felt some sympathy for Mr. chip alone, that result we are told by Liggett is going to be peeled and we have every confidence that it will be reversed on appeal this is a clear demonstration that those that these cases are just not worth pursuing, and I suspect that the six or so of the plaintiff law firms that are handling the majority of these cases around the country will kick quickly come to the same conclusion, reviewing this case remember that this jury completely exonerated all of the Defenders lorillard Phillip Morris and ligand of the principal charges, one of the companies fraudulently misrepresented and concealed material facts concerning health risks associated with cigarette smoking and two that the company's conspire prior to 1966 to misrepresent for concealed material facts about cigarette smoking and health, or three companies were exonerated of those charges furthermore we have heard much from the plaintiff's counsel and his colleagues throughout this case about the so-called secret company document they were going to reveal and they were going to prove the conspiracy alleged by the point, well it's abundantly clear that the jury completely rejected the distorted and the peace filled piecemeal misrepresentation of those company documents made by plaintiff's counsel when they decided in favor of the companies as I said on the issues of fraud misrepresentation and conspiracy there were no smoking guns among those company patients and that red herring of an issue is now, permenently put to rest, I want to make two more observations and then I'll turn the proceedings over to Mr. bring from Phillip Morris we should all remember that the real story of this litigation it's not a woman from New Jersey to smoke, but about money money about three very big very rich New Jersey Law Firms who decided to invest lots of their own time and their own money in the products liability litigation Lottery, sure they pose the self style champions of Rose chip alone, and yes they panned it too and panned by the whole crew of self-appointed anti-tobacco folks but everyone knows what they were really pursuing, but it wasn't solely to benefit by the rose for Tony AAA, finally the most important result of this case is that on the major issues before the jurors understood the people are still responsible for their own actions and that when something unfortunate happens to them they can't just sue and say someone else's full this jury, those in many other cases before the tobacco industry prior to 1988 have rejected that concept, and they said freedom of choice and personal responsibility still mean something, thank goodness for that it's my pleasure to introduce Marie bring the chief legal officer Phillip Morris, can you spell your name please B r i n g,  just like I said Thank You Arthur and thank you all so so much on behalf of Philip Morris I'd like to welcome you to this press conference he's General Counsel on appeal, i'd like to indicate the beginning that this is a press conference that we had planned before any verdict came in because we were anxious to have this opportunity to set the record straight, we obviously could not do that while the trial was going on despite the fact that there had been many irresponsible charges leveled against Philip Morris and the rest of the industry not only by mystery Dale but by mr. dinard and others who are prominent in the anti-tobacco ranks we were very anxious to have this opportunity to tell our side of the story and in that connection most of you I'm sure received when you came in a memorandum that has been prepared and is available, to any of you who do not have it and it tries to set in context the so-called chip alone documents and it tries to demonstrate as I think is clearly the case that not only Philip Morris but the entire industry has acted responsibly during the past 30 some years since the smoking and health controversy has been raging we're delighted to have this opportunity to set the record straight to tell our side of the story and to answer any questions that you might have concerning any, aspects of this litigation and particularly the documents about which so much has been written in the past four months I noticed in much of the Press today relating to the chip alone verdict that there have been some statements of confusion expressed by not only journalists but by other people who follow this industry and follow the litigation and there seems to be at least prevalent among some the notion that this is a confused verdict it's complicated, it and it's not clear exactly what the verdict means I'd like to take just a minute before we address any questions you might have to try to tell you from Philip Morris's perspective how we view this verdict

and it's very similar to what Arthur has just finished saying to you this has been a long case it lasted for five years it was prepared by a combination of three very as Arthur indicated well financed and large New Jersey Law Firms who were providing, I did virtually unlimited access to the files of the companies under the normal Discovery procedures of the federal court who had vast resources available to them not only in terms of the expert Witnesses whom they could retain 44 pay but also a vast support network of various anti-smoking organizations throughout the country it was as the plaintiffs themselves have indicated the most well financed most well-prepared case that has been brought to trial in the past, 30-some years by their own statements this was to be their best shot at the tobacco industry and I think it's against that background that we should really use the jury's verdict and the results of this case, what does the verdict say not only to those of us in this room but to Plagueis lawyers throughout the country and to perspective pinus throughout the country well first of all the jury concluded as Arthur is indicated that there simply was no fraudulent misrepresentation by Philip Morris by lorillard by Liggett and indeed by the entire industry and I think we can expand it to include the entire industry because the, which not only took Discovery from the three defendants in this case but they also took extensive Discovery from the tobacco Institute the Trade Organization of our association that represents the industry and from the files of the council for tobacco research the jury was presented over a four-month period with hundreds of documents selected from a body of several hundred thousand documents these documents were paraded in front of the jury day after day to the, testimony of various expert Witnesses various Snippets were taken out of context and what mystery Del the plaintiff's lawyer tried to do was to weave some sort of a web of fraud to seek conspiracy, the jury just didn't buy it by unanimous verdict the jury came back and concluded that the plaintiff had not established that any of these defendants had engaged in fraudulent misrepresentation by a unanimous verdict the jury returned indicated that the plaintiff had not established that these defendants or any one of them had engaged in a concealment of material facts relating to smoking and health by the unanimous verdict the jury indicated that the, why this had not established that there was a conspiracy among the tobacco industry to deceive and defraud the public, in short we think that this verdict stands for one proposition and one proposition only and that is that in the 30 some years at the smoking and health controversy has been raging this industry acted responsibly it addressed the issues in a straightforward manner it funded millions of dollars of independent research both outside and in-house and attempted in every way possible to try to address the criticism, that were being level against these products I think that is clearly the message that the jury has sent to the world I think that is the message that we are trying to convey to you today in the handout that was that was furnished you when you came in and that was clearly the testimony of Philip Morris's former Chief Executive Officer mr. Joseph Coleman who on the witness stand having been called by the plaintiffs as a, adverse witness described in great detail the responsible conduct of Philip Morris and the other members of this industry in the past 30 years in trying to find an answer to one of the most perplexing issues that face has Mankind and that is what causes cancer now many May conclude on that issue that the jury's verdict with respect to the failure to warn claim clearly establishes that smoking caused mrs. chip alone's cancer, is true that there is a question which the jury answered in the affirmative when they said that this her smoking was a proximate cause that is a contributing factor to her cancer but I noticed this interestingly this morning in this morning's edition of Newsday that one of the reporters who works for that newspaper was able to interview two of the jurors apparently last night and it's interesting what the foreperson of this jury said in that respect let me quote from the article, in today's edition of news big quote as to whether there was a link between cigarette smoking and cancer and ultimately death Mikan said quote I don't know if we can completely to that conclusion it's a contributing factor close quote now I suspect like ladies and gentlemen the members of this jury no more know what the answer to that question is that any of the rest of us than any of the scientific Community than any of the highwomen, Prince of independent investigators who have looked at this issue for the past 30 years the fact of the matter is and I think this is the thing that is so clear from the jury's verdict is that this industry has acted responsibly in that time period trying to find the answer and I have no doubt that the industry will continue to fund research in an effort to try to find out the answer to that question now on the question on the issue of the, failure to warn I think the important thing to recognize in terms of the jury's verdict in this instance is as Arthur has pointed out that the jury returned a resounding message that individuals who make informed choices have to take the responsibility for those choices, with respect to the failure to warn you are I'm sure all aware of the fact that the jury concluded that mr. mrs. chip alone should not have recovered any damages for liggett's failure prior to 1966 to issue a warrant and they also concluded that mr. chip alone should not have receive any damages for that now they could have sent a variety of messages under the law of New Jersey is I'm sure those of you who have read the judges instructions are aware, the plaintiff is foreclosed from recovering for an alleged failure to warn if the plaintiff undertook knowingly a risk and was 51 percent responsible for whatever injury resulted from that decision of the jury I suppose could have returned to verdicts and said we think mrs. chip alone was fifty-one percent responsible and therefore she should recover no damages but they didn't do that they sent a much stronger message, they held mrs. chip alone 80% responsible for whatever injury she sustained I think the message there is quite clear that mrs. chip alone undertook to smoke because of a informed decision that she made and that she should be held responsible for that decision in fact another quote from this article inner of the interview of these two jurors confirms that, again quoting the foreperson of the jury mrs. miggins the news they article States as follows and I quote it's just how much we thought she was responsible and how much they were responsible for making said we just considered where the responsibility lies for her smoking and lung cancer 80% was with her and 20% was with the tobacco company that's what the evidence proved to us I think as Arthur indicated that is a resounding in, or Smith of the notion of personal responsibility that has been the issue that has been tried and litigating these cases for the past 30 years it continues to be the Principal issue which I think is raised in these cases and it is for that reason that I believe the tobacco industry has a very strong position in these cases and it is also for that reason that I joined an Arthur in proclaiming that this was a major victory for the three defendants in this case, and for the industry I think one other point where as mentioned as well and that is in the jury's concluded that mrs. chip alone was 80% from responsible for her injury they have also rejected completely the notion that mrs. chip alone was addicted how can someone be 80% responsible and be addicted and again I think we find confirmation of that fact in the interview of two of these jurors, quoting from another section of this morning's newspaper, and the interview with another one of the jury people mrs. Riley she she is quoted as having said quote I don't think she was addicted closed book I think that's the clear message that this jury been paid, I think at this point what I would like to do is to open up the panel here any questions you might have I might I might before I even made more than just putting it before had do it I just like to make one other announcement that perhaps many of you aren't aware of I just heard it a couple of minutes ago myself and I haven't had a chance to read the decision yet or even see it but I'm reliably informed that the sixth circuit was morning unanimously affirmed the Roy's been case many of you may know, that is a case that was tried several years ago in Tennessee where r.j. Reynolds was a defendant r.j. Reynolds received a directed verdict on all claims one of the issues involved in the case was preemption of claims after 1966 that decision was appealed to the sixth circuit the art case was argued about a year and a half ago and I'm told that just today the sixth circuit has rendered its opinion, and in which it affirms the dismissal of the case against Reynolds so that now makes for circuit courts of appeals in the United States everyone that has considered the issue that have concluded that the 1966 labeling statute preempts any state claims after after 1966 so I think that's another indication of the strength of the position of this industry in this litigation I'm going to, back here so I can direct the question what you have I'd like you to ask questions, a treatment research lorillard rope historically The Joint industry funded smoking and health programs have not been selected against scientific goal specific signs every goal rather for various purposes purposes such as public relations political relations position for litigation to get so forth here is mr. John the Philip Morris scientist 1977 every 100 take a drink, Reynolds meeting sponsored by the battle people question certainly the obligation of that evidence was ever determine whether such accusations are true or false, the jury was the subject of extensive testimony by doctors fear the jury heard they could not assume they did not, conclude that the memo will is equal to as you would I wasn't it was a memo which portray me dr. fuse Muse suggesting ways to improve the coordination reorganization Merit of the industry-sponsored organization not all of his suggestions and followed and it is a prime example to use your words of a snippet of taking out of contact according as East meal way, statement made by a responsible industry number about industry research Arthur how would you have felt if this decision came out in the comparative negligence state I'm not going to speculate about how it would come out the jury found a T28 found that this trip alone they made their judgment decisions, blankets we're dollars I think it's only fair that now you finally say something about how much Houston what adalind I said fifty million dollars finally give us some kind of estimate you keep hammering away at that you haven't owned up to how much you spent well I'd let me say this that the traditional posture of the industry has been to defend these cases vigorously that has certainly been a very successful strategy I frankly don't know how much was spent in the, pensive this case but I am sure I can assure you that that we have spent whatever it was necessary to present our defense I think the fact of the matter is that when you have three defendants named in a case with the broad variety of allegations that were made and the five years of discovery that has taken place that is that it is not at all unusual to see any defendant not just tobacco companies but broadcasting companies news, papers manufacturing companies of all kinds to do whatever is necessary to mount an effective defense and that's what we have done Excuse me while you call this a victory for the tobacco industry if you expect there to be continued litigation well I think I think it's fair to say that there will be continued litigation in fact there's a case going on right now in Philadelphia the guertin case against American and there are, as I'm sure all of you know there are approximately 100 cases pending around the United States now I have no doubt that some of those cases will go to trial I suspect that there will be some of the plaintiffs lawyers who are involved in those cases we will want to have their opportunity to have their opportunity to take their turn at bat but I must say that in my opinion and this is obviously just conjecture I do not see the plane is far generally taking what, comfort from the verdict and Chip alone or finding much incentive in the kind of return on investment that mystery Del now has I really cannot estimate I'm I can tell you that I cannot, well I'm not going to get a discussion of the fees that we pay our lawyers I don't think that's relevant to the issues that are not ready because it cost too much these phases in our do not belong in the courts we have been Vindicated time after time again I think it's about, time that the judicial system of this country recognize that there is such a thing as personal responsibility that drain not only on these defendants but on the court system and on the federal budget in sponsoring cases of this type for months at a time is really a waste of assets and I whatever the amount is it's an amount that is being wasted and in my judgment I just got, finish saying I don't know, you comment on the judge wait a minute there's a question here on like to take first this could bring a soft public knowing principal issue in this case and that is the jury as a guest and that was the proximate cause of lung cancer event and they said yes or no smoking now doesn't that open the entire industry to a whole series of lawsuits are any smoker who spoke before 1950 I don't believe so the fact of the matter is despite the fact that the, he answered yes to question 15 the answer is 0 to the amount of Damages that should be awarded to mrs. chip alone these cases are about as Arthur said money if the plaintiff does not recover money they are not going to bring these cases this jury answered yes to that question it's not the first time that a question of that type of answer to yes by a jury but the fact of the matter is that you cannot recover damages by simply establishing one element of a cause of action, sure that is simply one element of the cause of action so I don't think it's going to open the floodgates I don't think for example that they're going to be very many plaintiffs lawyers around the country who are going to find that it's as attractive investment of their time and resources to establish to a jury that there may have been a contributing factor in the smoking to a disease if at the end of the road there's no recovery and that is what happened here on the cause of action that you're talking Myron evidently some iron, you said that the industry is continuing to search out the answer to raging controversy over whether smoking causes disease what kind of person will be necessary how many decades more will it take before you satisfy yourself that neither does it doesn't work well I think that's a question we still have that ought to be addressed to the National Cancer Institute to the Public Health Service to all of the public organizations that have invested billions of dollars in projects her answer on that, well they say they're sure but they don't have the evidence to support it the fact of the matter is and this was brought out an extensive testimony during the course of this product that there are three basic approaches to the issue of causation there is epidemiological evidence which is statistical evidence which even the plaintiffs experts conceded does not establish causation it merely indicates a basis for further, guys there is animal experimentation which consists primarily of skin painting tests which experts on both sides of the controversy admit do not establish that the creation of tumors on the backs of mice by painting highly concentrated doses of tobacco tar indicates that the ingestion of whole smoke into the human lung, causes cancer the most interesting and I think the most significant fact is that in the dozens of experiments that have been conducted over the years both by the industry and by hundreds of independent researchers where they have tried to induce the creation of tumors in the lungs of experimental animals through the inhalation of whole smoke that none of those experiments has created tumors I think that is the critical fact that is the basis upon which, this industry but a number of responsible scientists around the world have concluded that the scientific basis for causation has simply not been established in pulse mode never produce tumors in laboratory animals you'll never conclude based on anything else perhaps smoking causes well never never is a word that I don't like to use but the fact of the matter is that field of animals until the mechanism is discovered that makes no sense for us or in my in my view, anyone else to conclude that causation has been established we have a question back here this listen about Jen Sorokin mr. Stevens leveled some pretty serious charges of bias against the church I indicated that he demonstrated his hostility towards us he did so pretrial rules he did so with respect to this ruling on preemption which was reversed by the third Circuit Court of Appeals were made numerous efforts to accuse him we made at least four motion for mistrial it is clear, any reasonable reading of the record that many many of those rulings were preferential on warranted he set aside the local rules with respect to many many issues and it's there in the record he was not bashful about and his he demonstrated in his Motion in his opinion on our motion for dismissal given before any of the defendants evidence was there an, dream lies and practically laid out a guideline for the kinds of things that the jury could find that in my experience is unprecedent the press and others have indicated in his not only we do have indicated that it had hostility so yes as I indicated in my opening statement this was a case that had been troubling by the plaintiffs bar for many many years as the best case it became even a better case for then when the luck of the draw the wheel run up, Saturday we could not have had a more extreme adversary I think it'd be appropriate to have one of the trial counsel who actually litigated this case before Judge Sarah can make a comment on that question as well yeah well I think that at least two of the ruins with the judge entered during the trial were ruling which, has created some hostility towards the defendants the first was the judges taking over at the cross examination of one of the defense expert Witnesses during the entire planets case which went on for many many weeks we judge asked only one question of any witness and that was a question that truly was a question of clarification but one of the very first Witnesses the defense proton dr. Claude Martin Judge Sarah can essentially took over the Crossing, Elation of that witness and did so in a manner that I thought clearly convey to the jury his disbelief in that you can that Witnesses testimony and I stated so on the record at the time and I moved for a mistrial objected to the testimony objected to the questioning I mean by the court and I move for a mistrial and that faces the second was of course the judge's ruling on our motion for a directed verdict which the judge granted in part and denied in part in my experience when a judge denied a motion for directed, verdict at the close of the plaintiffs case it enters a and oral opinion or a very brief written opinion in which the court concludes simply that there is a basis upon which a jury could find in this case a conspiracy to issue a 12 page ruling middle of the trial which excoriates the defendants for conduct that he obviously believes those defendants engaged in is in my experience at least completely unprecedented and was almost certainly going to resolve in wide publicity, the city including in all of the local newspapers which in fact is exactly what occurred when in the headlines of the local newspapers including the Bergen Record was the were the words judge finds conspiracy and to suggest that any jury in a case that is why isn't as widely publicized as this one is not going to have that kind of information come to its attention is naive and it's worth the basis upon which we moved for a mistrial as well mr. Riley, about that to me that there who saw ads not only four-legged Premier Companies in the 1950s and 1960s prior to 1966 obviously these documents created an atmosphere where a jury was willing to return a verdict against somebody for, wired all you going to be what what why why are all of you going to be liable on the same advertising claims in cases that involve people who smoke your brains part in a well I think first to suggest that the documents as you call them had anything to do with the jury's verdict is misplaced I don't think those documents have anything whatsoever to do with the breach of warranty claim and I don't think that the plaintiffs lawyers argued them to the jury as, any such problem those documents look at the question no I don't think they did because if they were going to affect the atmosphere of the courtroom in the atmosphere that would have been affected with the charge that mystery Del tried to convince this jury was the most serious one and that is the charge of conspiracy that's what all of those documents addressed the notion that there was a conspiracy that breach of warranty claim was based on and was presented to the jury as having been based on handful of Liga dad's in the, TS and nothing more than that and I think there are three very important things to take into account your although this is a claim against Legacy better able to deal with it the Mayan first all of those ads have been presented to juries in the past on a claim of breach of Express warranty and the juries have invariably in the past on the same evidence returned verdicts poorly for the defendants and against Plans on the very thing that happens but upon a, three different charge and that's a very important Point here but charge that this case, the charge with which this case went to the jury was a charge that was loaded in favor of the plaintiff especially on the issue of Reliance and especially on the issue of what it takes to make an Express warranty there are a number of these Express warranty claims have been thrown out by judges and never gone to juries before and the final point of course is that the jury this is a essentially a breach of contract claim and the jury in this case found that the person who entered into a contract with Liggett assuming there was any such contract have no, images the jury didn't allow the person who was given the promise to recover any damages but instead gave damages to mr. Chaplin and it's on that basis among others that Leggett and I agree with them I think has a very sound basis for having that verdict overturned on appeal my question is why can't this happen again and again it has happened before and it undoubtedly will happen again what I'm saying to you John is but I think that with a proper charge the overwhelming majority of the jury, juries presented with this kind of claim assuming a court allows the claim to go to a jury and they have not only the overwhelming majority of those cases the jury's going to return Apparition favor of the defendant mr. LeDoux, we've also said that he wanted to product to be developed you know that the wisdom of that kind of introduction is open to debate the Foresters evolve the main purpose of your research was to the health benefits of your consumers that seems to me to be something that's well I don't see any inconsistency the, the purpose of the research was clearly to try to find out as much about the product as we could to try to find out what is in the product and what effect it has the documents that you were referring to the early part of your question relate to an undertaking that was made over a period of time to try to ascertain why people smoke, and a number of experiments were conducted most of the documents I think you're referring to were prepared by dr. Dunn who is one of the scientists who works at Ligety certainly is not a person who makes policy allergens on behalf of the company he I'm sorry I said he is a person who expressed himself in these documents as he saw I think the interesting thing is despite the manner in which those documents for use, and the impression that mr. Reed L tried to convey to the jury that mr. Dunn and Philip Morris were convinced that nicotine is addictive is that there is not a single statement in any of those documents which suggests that even dr. Dunn thought that nicotine is addictive I think the most important fator is to take away however is that the jury didn't think that nicotine is addictive that was the clear implication of their ruling that	 Kipling was 80% responsible and that's clearly what mrs. Ryan says one more	 that is what you're concerned about in your research nonetheless you're saying that that's what you sell but that's that's a statement that dr. Dunn made in a in a document that he wrote I don't think that is the position of the company that is not what we sell he sells cigarettes we still have product that consumers want and like and enjoy smoking what dr. Dunn was trying to do was to ascertain what is it that motivates people to smoke the pharmacological effects of	 teaching are very diverse they're very complicated I don't think anybody including the Surgeon General really knows exactly what all of those effects are some people say they smoke because it gives them pleasure other people say they smoke because it relieves tension other people say they smoke because it makes them feel good other people that there are many many reasons why people say they spoke and I think it's responsible for an industry that produces a product to try to find out why people use their product and that's what this research was directed	 lady in white beer please could you identify yourself	 meanwhile in the court of public opinion we have Anisa tality restaurants Airlines offices Banning smoking isn't it possible while you're spending Millions litigating these cases that there is a change of Lifestyle in the country and that you're losing in the court of public opinion well I think you're really talking about two different things what this conference was called to discuss was a verdict in the chip alone case and we're	 lawyers and we deal with the cases that we have to defend your raising obviously another question which is certainly relevant and important and that is what is the social environment for smoking in the United States there's no question that I think people's attitudes about smoking are going through a transformation people are looking at smoking some people at least differently from others but I think the fact of the matter is and this is I think important to remember is that	 five to sixty million people in this country still smoke they still enjoy smoking they demand and want the product and I think it's important to realize that those 55 to 60 million Americans have rights just as well as everyone else and that they should be protected in the expression of their rights just as just	 but why are controls the fifth week of the wild boar to start before the trial counsel	 it's clear however that as I indicated at the outset that one of the other reasons that the chip alone case was the a success because it would be the first case in some time to come to full-blown trial in exactly the social environment that you described but this jury was able to separate out the two and was able to see the difference in social attitudes towards smoking which are clearly those that you described	 and whether this point was entitled to compensation and Recovery it's a life law and in some respects that's what makes the chip alone case clearly was very similar to other cases a landmark case because it isn't just that social environment that we were able to convince the jury that we did not do the irresponsible of the unreasonable things that will suggested also the first case where a jury did not ascribe	 sense of responsibility to the smoker so isn't it possible that there is if it is based on the environment or real change in the Public's perception of response there is a change in the Public's perception of these cases of becoming more and more difficult to win but they can be one we have one and we will continue to do you want to respond to Morton's weapons	 and I don't know where you got your information but if someone is well there was never anything said in a court hearing anybody was trying to evade process if you have your recollection your wrecked your recollection is you're flipping is incorrect because no one from Laura large that they can service of any process whatsoever in this lawsuit or any other laws according to the transcript which I read before I wrote the story process servers went to his apartment mr. Ave	 golf courses and he doctored the judge common never mind what I say perhaps he wasn't home this Dimension is certainly the duct is your surgery was successful in making service in balancers and number of occasions these in your articles we can suspend the gentleman	 from Lord that was or evaded process during the course of this trial if anyone has said that that was a mistake businessweek please	 normal grounds for reversal on appeal fishermen see Stephen you detectives bring up any kind of official proceeding about the judges activities in the case you plan to raise these on a few well what can we not try to take us for not taking you feel since we want anyone else traveled a lot of testimony about the N64 surgeon general's advisory committee	 and the exchange of documents and Cooperative work that went on back and forth between the industry the Surgeon General is Pierce it now there's deportment adversary relationship between the two entities that seems to be diametrically opposed conclusion how do you proceed the industry research at this point interacting with what certain dental work is well I think you raise a very valid point and I think it's one worth spending a moment on there is a very significant distinction between the current Surgeon General and the surgeon	 1964 and what he did and how he went about creating the night and 64 report he created an advisory committee to look into the issue of smoking and health and he took pains to a point to that committee people who had an open mind on the issue in other words he did not want to appoint a committee that would simply endorse whatever use he might have about the issue of smoking and health I think it was in there for an environment that created	 added a sense of cooperation and invited cooperation not only from the industry but from all of the scientific community that were interested in the issue I think it's fair to say that the current incumbent of the office approaches these issues which is a much different perspective he has proclaimed many times publicly that it is his intention to try to create a smoke free Society by the year 2000 I think it is fair to say that an objective reading of his last	 to surgeon general's reports are leaving the conclusion that those were political statements designed to support his objective of creating a smoke free Society by the year 2000 on the issue of environmental tobacco smoke which was his 1986 report I think if you look at that carefully you will find that there simply is no scientific evidence to support his conclusions I think if you look at his 1987 report on addiction you	 will find that there is no scientific evidence to support his conclusions these are political statements that he has made has been very effective in doing so but the environment that he is created makes it difficult to cooperate frankly if he's not interested in finding objectivity I question whether nightmares print your lies the debate that any other questions appears that the government's Public Health policy seems to indicate this the that there's a Groove and possibly but the government's Health policy I think is being dictated by a person who is	 these issues politically rather than scientifically and I would hope that in the future there will be a Surgeon General who will approach it more objective based back of the room please	 well I don't know how 50 million people evaluate anything but I think that the fact of the matter is that these 50 million or 60 million people who smoke just like rose trip alone and just like myself smoke because we want to because we enjoy it	 we don't we make a conscious informed decision that we are going to undertake this habit or custom and I think and I think that I would hope that they assume that that they are taking responsibility for the decision they made	 I don't think I mean that every person is free to do to reach whatever conclusion they want about the dangers and risks of smoking or anything else they do like eating red meat or walking on the street or hang gliding or anything else that involves risks I think that's the kind of decision that people make all the time every day of their lives and they make those decisions and I think they must be held accountable and responsible Francis Burns	 you reconciled putting down the Surgeon General which you just did in which your lawyers and public relations people did throughout the trial call your pediatrician of politicians have been quoting to a juror you know expertise on addiction or any other area of medicine how do you reconcile the reconciliation is that reconciliation is as mr. green has pointed out	 at the Surgeon General regrettably the pediatricians and Obstetricians whatever he is has politicized the entire process and indeed has created an environment which if some Corporation between the government and the industry were possible it would be very very difficult to bring about what we are saying is that the jurors whose decision was I don't think have to be reconciled with anything other than Common Sense heard the evidence with respect to mrs. chip alone and concluded their interviews	 to be believed and I assume they are that she was not addicted so there's no there's really no need to reconcile the double by being a surgeon general's report on that you're ready lady here in the second row	 you identify yourself the mmm	 well I certainly I certainly young lady would like to know what responsibility I assume for smoking in a room full of people and they responsibility that I assume is to comply with the law and I was told when I came into this room and I inquired whether it was permissible to smoke in this room and I was told that it was if it bothers	 a number of people I obviously will accommodate anyone who feels that they are being put upon but I also think it's important to recognize that even though I work for a tobacco company I have personal rights as well John Moon back here we are week of using internal Communications memos documents from public relations purposes been set in the inner trial which you was Council recommends to expect companies that you work for that	 that they change their strategies in terms of communication in any way what would you say a precedent established it there are there have been many many other cases without having many other companies and industries in which company documents have been introduced if you lean on all we going to have a wholesale renovation of our record retention program or manner in which we communicate the answers the question the back of the room way back there	 there's an exchange love it like the big little more stock is how to create a drop of what about 10% of the price of the stock how do you do that and also again pressure is this particular of 500 people to stop smoking isn't really the writing on the wall for this industry I mean called Mars itself is diversifying and white food companies beer companies everything else isn't really the right now	 wall here well I'm not gonna make a comment as to the price of stock because that's just not my ball game is the writing on the wall the environment with respect to smoking particularly public smoking has change the diversification that you talked about that has taken place with respect to a number of tobacco companies is not new that diversification has been taking place for over 30 years so whether that's an indication of some handwriting on the wall of some Specter that you see you enjoy your own	 is cigarette smoking is not as popular at activity as it was 30 years ago but a lot of other things are not as well that is not at issue what is at issue is what use is made properly of the courts what use is made of litigation as a means of recovering for what you consider to be an alleged wrong when you are well informed and make a freedom of choice and you will continue to try and divert attention from that but that's what the	 sultan this case is important we're going to read	 networking impact on the industry is hostile climate surrounding sales are down or smoking what's the impact on the industry the industry and it's a tough business I think it's a very I think it's a very healthy industry the fact of the matter the fact	 of the matter is that the litigation that you refer to has not had a significant impact I think it's a very manageable problem I think the chip alone verdict will make it even more manageable there's no question as Arthur has indicated that there are changing attitudes about smoking but the fact of the matter is that there are still as I've indicated 55 to 60 million people in this country who smoke and hundreds of millions of people in other countries who smoke and enjoy smoking	 so I don't think to also answer the similar question in the back that any handwriting is on the wall I think that this is a very healthy industry I think one need only look at the financial results of the companies in the industry to recognize if that's the case let's take good just about one or two more questions mr. Carey	 remember neither of these clients are appealing for we won we don't have to fear I think the strongest grounds later had to appeal our reach a warranty claim or first they will argue that their motion for summary judgment which was filed before the trial and the motion for directed verdict was filed during the trial should have been granted by the judge that there was as a	 matter of law no material fact in dispute that is no Express warranty as that term is used in the law was made and I think that the trial and the evidence that was offered in support of the breach of warranty claim demonstrated that there was never an Express warranty in the first place so I think that's the first ground the second round is the charge the details of the charge of breach of warranty and I'm not an expert on this so I can't tell you what they all are but what I do know one serious problem	 Liggett perceived in the charge and in the verdict form is that it appeared to commit because of the way the verdict form was written and the way the charge was delivered a verdict to find that the person who entered into the contract that is mrs. Chip alone suffered no damage has no injury and that is in fact what the jury did find but somehow awarded damages and found injury on the part of someone who didn't enter into the contract and that's not contract law that's a bizarre result that I	 I think was produced by a verdict form that should not have been used by the court and a charge that should not have been delivered I think those are the principal Browns for fuel thank you very much ladies and gentlemen
