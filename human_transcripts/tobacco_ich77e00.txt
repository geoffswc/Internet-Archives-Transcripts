Rises above barriers of language and geography Dynamic Brands generating Unforgettable excitement. A very strong defenses on the merits if we have to go to trial in the merits we expect to win I think it's interesting that if you look at what judge Jones did in the castano case you'd have to conclude that the plaintiffs lawyers can't be very happy about it either because he has created a situation in which they cannot expect even if they Prevail to collect the first dime of Damages if they win,for decades because the first thing they have to go through is first of all sending notice to the class which will probably end up costing them several million dollars they will then have to have discovery on the common issues that he is certified they will then have to have a trial on those common issues before a jury and even if they win some issues in that common in that common issue trial they still won't collect anything because they're then going to have to go, and try millions of individual cases or cases around the country this is clearly not the game plan that they had in mind I'm sure what they had in mind was trying to get a class-wide certification on everything in the hope that that would terrorize the industry into some sort of quick settlement and as I've indicated before they're up against the wrong industry on that we don't intend to do that, Larry Adelman from Dean Witter irrespective of the litigation out look I wonder whether the twenty percent successful spin-off of Reynolds Food business Nabisco has in any way changed your thoughts about the spin-off of your food businesses the answer that is no, our own observation don't suggest that any values passed through to our J.R. its early days Larry's so one would need to wait and see but the answer right now is no, here's a question, excuse me, if I could go back to a litigation question your you've mentioned a couple times that under castano there would be the requirement for millions of individual trials obviously the plaintiffs don't expect that and they're hoping for some sort of sampling and extrapolation methodology what's the likelihood of something like that and secondly do you agree that the Samino decision will be important to the fifth circuit in determining whether sampling is is acceptable and therefore this case could therefore be manageable, well let me say first of all I think it's quite interesting that judge Jones in his opinion said nothing about sampling or extrapolation is in fact if you read his opinion carefully I think the only conclusion you can come to is that the way he's thinking about it now is there would have to be individual trials because he said that very clearly under the Seventh Amendment were entitled to a jury trial on all of the individual issues that he refused to certify now that doesn't mean that down the road he may not take another look at it and in that connection, I think what the fifth circuit does in shamino could be relevant Judge Parker you as you know has been grappling with that shamino fiberboard situation for years and he has repeatedly tried to come up with some formula that will help him to dispose of not millions of cases but only 3,000 cases and he still has not succeeded the last extrapolation exercise that he engaged in as you know is what is now on appeal to the fifth circuit in the shamino case, I understand that the argument in that case went very well from the defendants point of view and I think there's a good likelihood that the fifth circuit will have serious concerns about what Judge Parker did but even if they should affirm in some way some of what Judge Parker did I don't think that creates a precedent for our situation because you have as I said in shamino only 3,000 members of the class in our situation you're going to have, upwards of 50 60 70 million members of the class and I don't think it's going to be easy to develop some sort of a test case extrapolation Theory upon which to try those cases you know in castano the judge did ask the plaintiffs to submit a trial plan which they did and which was totally deficient in terms of responding to his request for something that would indicate how this is going to be handled down the road so they basically weren't responsive to the judges request and interestingly the judge never said a word about that trial plan so I think he may be waiting also to see what happens in shamino just as we all are but I think irrespective of what happens in shamino and I'm hoping and expecting a favorable result there that we have as judge Jones said a assuage and Eris K assuage and Eris case and that I don't think anything that's happened in any other case in the past will provide any guidance for what's going to happen in this situation, which, which is incidentally why I think the fifth circuit will reverse if they if they take judge Jones opinion on appeal okay will the manageability issue be compared to the less than 100 cases outstanding in the country today or will it be compared to the millions of potential lawsuits under the theory that there's millions of people who'd be in this class who have no, chance of winning a suit on their own but they would if they if they could go this route which will they compare that manageability issue to I think that's a very good question and of course I always hate to predict how a court will analyze anything but it seems to me that the right way to analyze it as I tried to suggest in my comments earlier is to compare the manageability problem that is created by what Joan judge Jones did here in certifying a class for any purpose against the, sixty-six cases that are now pending in the United States I mean the that's what I meant when I said that judge Jones has really created a crisis where none existed we don't have a crisis in tobacco litigation today they're only 66 cases out there the fact of the matter is the vast majority of smokers have no interest in litigation what judge Jones has done by certifying a class is to draw in tens of millions of people into a lawsuit that they never had any interest in nor probably know anything about, this isn't this is not a situation where you have a lot of people out in the country looking for some remedy this is a situation where you have a group of trial lawyers who are taking some statements that were made last year by commissioner Kessler and by Henry Waxman and trying to convert it into a big class action which will have hopefully from their point of view a big payday for them at the end and I think the fifth circuit is sophisticated enough to see that for that reason I think the proper standard and I think the proper the standard they will apply is to compare the manageability of the current situation where we have 66 cases against what would be Unleashed if a class action were to go forward thank you Mary we haven't had any questions from the back so if there's anybody down there it's a little hard to see there's one over here, okay one of the things that plaintiffs law firms are counting on to bolster their case against the tobacco companies is the discovery of a brown & Williamson internal document on y1 Tobacco apparently internal memos supposedly indicate that BW was trying to manufacture a brand of tobacco with twice the nicotine of tobacco with similar tar content could this undermine the tobacco industry is contention that's its knowledge nicotine is not addictive, - and it's merely been produced as a by-product in cigarette manufacturer,  let me say that I don't I don't think so and I don't think it should because as I said during my remarks in the in the final analysis the real question that juries look at they're not really interested too much and how you Define addiction or whether cigarettes are addictive or not and there are 20 different definitions of addiction what they really look at and I think what they should look at is whether or not someone who wanted to smoke who wanted to quit tried to quit and, that has come up repeatedly time and again in the cases we have taken to trial and also in the focus groups that we had and mock trials that we have around the country there's been a lot written about these Brown and Williamson documents I'm not intimately familiar with them but and more importantly I'm not intimately familiar with what the authors of those documents would say and I think that's very significant the Brown & Williamson counsel advised us that they believe all of those documents are, explainable and that certainly doesn't surprise me because that was our own experience in the chip alone case where the plaintiff's lawyer repeatedly would take little Sig segments or Snippets out of context would go to the media and say look what we found here this is a clear indication that the industry is engaged in misconduct but the fact of the matter is when we got to trial and the jury had an opportunity to see all of the documents and not simply little excerpts taken out of, context and to hear the explanations of the people who wrote those documents they ended up finding in the defendants favor and I would expect that will continue to happen with respect not only to our own documents but to BMWs documents and other documents thank you Mary any more questions he's over here, in the ABC litigation it's not quite clear to me what your ultimate goal is is it a slap in the risk and some public humiliation or is your position moving towards one of some economic pain towards the defendants in that case are you from ABC with Wellington Management but our goal is to own ABC, and hopefully that will increase the bonuses to the legal department seriously let me say this we brought that lawsuit in part out of a sense of total outrage about the lies that were contained in that program and in part to vindicate ourselves because we think that that program has had a significant impact on the way opinion  leaders and congressmen and the public think of us and in part to as part of that Vindication to secure damages we did not we did not bring that lawsuit lightly we did not do it for a public-relations ploy we did not do it because we wanted to put the media on the defensive as some people have said we did it because we thought ABC was outrageous that they lied they knew they lied and we think we're going to be, would prove that and we thought long and hard about what to ask for in terms of Damages and frankly I don't think ten billion dollars is too much when you consider the damage that that Pro that those programs have had thank you Mory now we are getting to adjourn outside and there are drinks and so forth and we would like you to be able to talk to all of us so I can take two or three more questions before we do that if you like and then we can go outside Lee, I guess I'm supposed to introduce myself I'm Lee first from SG Warburg and my question is about the combination of American Tobacco and brown and Williamson can you comment on how that's changed the competitive landscape for instance will you still try to maintain a premium for basic over other discounted brands from Jimmy answer Jimmy, the u.s. cigarette industry is characterized in my judgment as an industry that had six companies in it any one of whom at any given moment could start something that was problematic for us or anybody else it's an industry where each company has had successes over the years and I believe the significance of the merger or acquisition of American brands by Brown & Williamson goes something like this, the good news is there's one less competitor in the industry so we have five companies instead of six the bad news is that there's one stronger competitor in the industry and that's the combination of American brands and brown and Williamson which now is a company that has somewhere between a 17 and 18 percent market share, it will definitely be a stronger company they have stronger asset base they have Salesforce assets and they have operating efficiencies that are available to them however it's interesting that with all our scale as Philip Morris we cannot get every brand displayed at retail in fact arguably we have trouble getting more than three brands displayed in a really good position at retail so I'm not sure whether this new, and Company is going to be able to reach out with its increased size and do a heck of a lot more in the marketplace than brown and Williamson was able to do on its own however we respect that company we respect them as a formidable worldwide competitor and they are definitely stronger in the United States market so our antenna or up and we'll watch it play out and we will continue to trade basic at a premium as we showed one more question, yeah Mark Cohen from Goldman Sachs Jeff you know you've done all the right things since since last August, you've grown the earnings rapidly you raise a dividend you initiated a stock buyback but the stock hasn't moved and I'm wondering how that experience affects the way you think about the financial resources that are available to your options that are available to you you know in a non-operating sense to build that value of it has hesitated your taste for dividend hikes and share, or change your thinking in any way well firstly maybe I got it wrong but the stock was 15 it's now 60 so that's 10 bucks that's 20% so I feel pretty good about that and that's in eight months so fact I keep that up every eight months I'd be thrilled mates, Bill Murray and I outlined a strategy which are repeated here and we said that in June listen there are two things we're going to do we got to grow the business provide the cash to reinvest back in the business and we will then distribute the rest to the shareholders and we have been doing that and I don't think there is a company in the world in fact I know there isn't a company in the world that has given more to its shareholders in the past year than Philip Morris has given to its shareholders in the past year I do believe that there has been, uptick in the stock and I think given the seven increases in the interest rates that we've experienced that we would have seen a higher increase in the stock if it hadn't been for that so getting from 50 to 60 in the environment we've been in and given seven interest rate hikes I think it's pretty good my own sense is as people see how the litigation begins to unfold about which we feel confident the robustness of our business which we've attempted to describe to you the day and our, going forward policy and as I said to you as I see our business is continuing to grow and throw off cash will be recommending to the to the directors how we think that money should be dished out and we have two things in mind one reinvest in the business to grow the business and to return the money to the shareholders it hasn't tainted my view let me tell you I feel pretty good about how its gone so far, am I wrong about the 50 60, I have a plaque to prove it, my point was more not not not an absolute price but the multiple stock price multiple still being fairly compressed relative to where it has been and and your satisfaction with that they look you're right about that and I think we would all agree that the issue is the litigation and how it affects the valuation within the stock price valuation the domestic tobacco business so you have to see how that unfolds put that aside the rest of the business couldn't be in better shape so one just has to go through the period, letting that thing take its course and the next important thing I feel is what was discussed here today what happens in the shamino you know case we'll see what happens then we'll move forward on that and see how things unfold beyond that we'd like the stock that I said I think I believe the stock is highly undervalued I mean on any measure it's highly undervalued but some of it's out of our control, I mind you I should add and I didn't completely answer Gary's question we've never planned for failure in this company we've always planned for Success we plan to grow the businesses infinitely we plan to win the litigation and we plan to grow shareholder returns year after year generation after generation and that is our plan well on that note let me close the meeting in thank you very much for coming and being with us today and please have a drink with us outside.
