you have several more hearings and then beginning on March 12th mark up this bill so that we can get it to the floor of the Senate and move forward on this settlement, the proposed settlement is built around a central premise in exchange for receiving certain limitations of liability the industry would agree to make payments numbering in the hundreds of billions of dollars in concede to the imposition of various and limitations on the advertising marketing and sale of tobacco products, Mr. Chairman we want to hear you and if you can close the door back there in the noise and crowd outside the lined up out in the streets this morning, thank you very much Senator Ford thank you very much Senator ford, the revenue stream from industry payments would be available to fund health research counter advertising campaigns smoking cessation programs and provide compensation for losses due to the use of harmful tobacco products also underpinning the settlement is the stated desire of the major tobacco companies to take a new approach to their business practices this is the idea that the proposed settlement involves a change in the culture of the tobacco companies the nation welcome such a change in fact, the nation demands it the recent release of various internal tobacco documents makes it clear that historically tobacco companies have failed the Candor test despite the industry assurances in testimony to the contrary we know now that the tobacco companies have long known that nicotine is addictive the extent to which smoking is harmful to health that there are ways to enhance nicotine kick and cigarettes, and that marketing programs have been targeted at kids the tobacco companies simply must face the fact that because of your industry's history you have a significant credibility problem the American public in this committee deserve the truth inside this hearing room and now we expect it and we demand It Whatever the scope of tobacco legislation our primary goal is clear and unambiguous to dramatically reduce tobacco use by children, I'll consider potential tobacco legislation a failure if we're not confident it will achieve significant reductions in you smoking I also believe this committee and the American people are in agreement on this goal I look forward to a critical analysis of the many questions apposed by tobacco legislation I thank the CEOs for coming to this hearing I look forward to your testimony into the discussion that follows I'd like to ask members if they have brief comments Senator ford, thank you mr. chairman I want to thank you personally for calling this hearing this morning there's been a lot of attention in the media about the tobacco settlement and what impact the settlement might have on the public health the federal Treasury and on Tobacco companies one aspect of the settlement though has been neglected its impact on Tobacco farmers and their communities, mr. chairman there's 60,000 tobacco farmers in my state of Kentucky alone and over 120,000 throughout the southeast they grow different types of tobacco in different states but they all depend on the same thing that the tabacco program administered by USDA, the tobacco program which keeps prices high and limits the supply of tobacco is paid for by the tobacco farmer and their customers many of whom are with us today a no net cost assessment is paid on each pound of tobacco to ensure that taxpayers never foot the bill for the price support program in addition to the no net cost assessment Farmers also pay a budget deficit assessment that contributes about 30 million dollars to, treasury each year this assessment isn't collected from any other producer just the tobacco farmer despite the fact that the program is paid for despite the fact that tobacco Farmers paid to reduce the deficit and despite the fact that the president and many and public health communities now support the program and that's right mr. chairman they support the program there are senators and others who want to take this program away from the farmers who pay for it and run it, mr. chairman I want to emphasize the support of the Public Health Community for the tobacco program major public health groups are working with tobacco Farmers to develop a set of core principles to govern the debate on Tobacco policy this includes groups like The National Center for tobacco-free kids and the American Public Health Association principle number one reads as follows and I quote the parties agree that it Tobacco production control program which limits Supply and which sets a minimum price purchase price is in the best interest of the Public Health Community and the tobacco producing community and surgeongeneral Coop and former FDA commissioner David Kessler have gone on record supporting the continued operation of the tobacco program so long as it operates at no cost to the taxpayer now I'm going to be asking our Witnesses a little more about the program and what it means to States like Kentucky but the bottom line, line mr. chairman is this ending the tobacco program means throwing tens of thousands of farmers out of work it means the end of hundreds of rural communities throughout the southeast it means spending hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayers dollars and it means providing as much as a billion dollar windfall to the tobacco companies every year many senators including you mr. chairman have agreed with me that the tobacco farmer must be taken care of in any settlement adopted by the Congress even the president in his five principles has acknowledged finally that protections for the farmer and his community must be a key part of any legislation My fact is co-sponsored by Senators Hollings and frisked on this committee as well as six other tobacco state senators mr. chairman I'm grateful to you that you have Incorporated this Farm proposal in Your settlement bill that you introduced it does protect the, a farmer and his community and it does so by starting with the thing that keeps those communities thriving in the first place the program that ought to be the litmus test of any farmer proposal, since the June 20th agreement was announced we've seen a number of proposals to implement the settlement I think many of us on this committee would agree that these proposals are spinning out of control the latest proposal would raise tobacco taxes by a dollar and a half per pack and require the industry to pay fifteen billion dollars up front it includes penalties which include could add another dollar 70 per packed and even this extreme proposal isn't, the end of the road I've taken the time to total up the various proposals that have been floated to spend monies collected by the settlement the settlement assume that payments in the first five years would be fifteen nine billion dollars the present budget assumes a higher figure sixty six billion when you add up all of the other proposals health research funding child care tax cuts Elementary class size reduction and many others the total of, of all the ideas and Congress so far on how to spend tobacco money exceeds 126 billion dollars in the first five years more than double the original settlement, we need a reality check mr. chairman I believe we're at the point where we're really talking about funny money dollars that will never be there to fund all these wonderful programs why because we may just drive the companies into bankruptcy by demanding too much too fast I didn't support the latest proposal to be offered in fact I along with three other Democratic colleagues wrote to the vice president urging him to begin bipartisan negotiations on a settlement, we can pass I renew that call today because as I said in our letter partisan proposal simply have no chance of becoming law on this point mr. chairman I want to compliment you yours is the only Bill out there that is bipartisan I appreciate that and I appreciate you're beginning a process today that I hope will lead to a strong bipartisan Bill a bipartisan bill will do what's necessary to fight teen smoking, we've lost the whole thrust the righteous indignation ending indignation in the beginning against tobacco has now turned into greed and it will do what's necessary to protect the tens of thousands of farmers who depend on debate on Tobacco so thank you mr. chairman for your leadership and I look forward to today's testimony thank you very much Senator Ford Center Burns, mr. chairman I would ask unanimous consent that my entire statement be made part of the record I will just have a couple of statements out of Jackson, back June 20th and 1997 when the settlement was reached between the tobacco companies and most of the state's attorney generals, that accomplished some goals most of us would not have believed that could have been reached in our lifetimes it was it would substantially raise the price of cigarettes and tobacco items
