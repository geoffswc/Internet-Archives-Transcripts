Day 1, Reel 1: Begins with multimedia (music, video, dance) production with the conference theme, ""Take Charge of Tomorrow.""  Corporate leadership and senior management give an overview of Philip Morris' sales performance since the previous national sales meeting held three years earlier and a general presentation of future goals.  Topics mentioned include Philip Morris magazine, the importance of protecting the right to market their products, attempting to reach a 50% market share in the United States, and the demographics of smokers purchasing Philip Morris brands.  Two spoofs featuring puppets of George and Barbara Bush and Lee Iacocca are interspersed with the presentations.

Day 1, Reel 2: Senior management review 1988 sales performance and discuss 1989 goals.  Topics include brands (particularly Marlboro, Virginia Slims, Merit, Benson & Hedges, Cambridge and Alpine), market share, distribution mechanisms, pricing, market demographics (particularly young adults, Blacks, older smokers, and women), price value brands, supermarkets and convenience stores, competition with R.J. Reynolds, external threats (California excise tax), shelf space, and coupons.  At the end of management's presentation there is a short video spoofing Surgeon General C. Everett Koop.

Day 1, Reel 3: Starts with a bell boy calling for Philip Morris and then a video segment spoofing Jesse Jackson.  Guy Smith delivers address on the theme of the right to choose to smoke.  He points to the anti-smoking movement's advocacy of smoking as a socially unacceptable behavior and the successes of that movement including the passage of Propositions 99 and 65 in California and increases in excise taxes nationally and locally.  He goes on to associate the potential effect of the tobacco control movement with fascism and Nazism.  While he is speaking there is a video presentation in the background.  He exhorts the gathered sales force to view themselves as freedom fighters like Civil Rights Movement activists, soldiers in WWII, and astronauts in the Space Program.  He emphasizes the importance of Philip Morris influencing public opinion through strengthening its relationship with mass media outlets, using celebrities as advocates, and the distribution of Philip Morris Magazine.  Smith's presentation is followed by a short video spoofing Sylvester Stallone and a live musical and dance number, ""Take Charge of Tomorrow.""

Day 2, Reel 1: This session is set up as a morning television talk show ""PM in the AM"" with hosts sportscaster Dick Schapp, Deborah Norville, and Dave McCaulay. Issues covered include the recent sales force expansion, the Masters Program, and marketing Marlboro.  Members of Philip Morris management are ""interviewed.""  Interspersed throughout are cigarette commercials, television news coverage of PM sponsored events, and pretaped segments from the field.

PHILIP MORRIS INC.","The witness, Chairman, CEO and President of Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company, was deposed by the plaintiffs. He stated that the company's best-selling brand in the U.S. is GPC. He acknowledged that smoking is clearly associated with all the diseases warned about on cigarette packages. He indicated, however, that it has not been scientifically proven that physical smoking or passive smoking causes diseases. His company is not researching whether smoking causes diseases, but it is funding the Council for Tobacco Research to investigate this topic. The witness stated that one purpose of the Frank Statement was to allay the fears that consumers had regarding smoking and diseases. He indicated that it has not been Brown & Williamson's intention to convey to consumers the message that a low-tar cigarette is less hazardous than a high-tar cigarette. He denied that research documents had been destroyed by Brown & Williamson. He admitted that the nicotine in smoke may cause physiological changes in smokers.","tobacco, cigarettes, deposition, advertising, health effects, public awareness, industry activity, addiction, smoking cessation, Passive Smoking"

He announces his intention to change the corporate culture to one in which performance will be rewarded.  He dispels a number of rumors including ones about reductions in wages, health insurance benefits, and layoffs.  He acknowledges that the anti-smoking movement is likely to grow but points to Reynolds' support of smokers' rights groups.  He says that the anti-smoking movement is mistaken that the company targets Blacks, youth and white women in their advertising and that the introduction of the Uptown cigarette brand was not racist.  After Johnston's talk, there is a promotional video, ""Smokers' Rights"" about R.J.Reynolds' program to sponsor smokers' rights groups around the country.  It includes testimonials from smokers and how the program is structured.

Both products are being test marketed. Pfeil touts the benefits of Accord as having no lingering odor, vastly reduced sidestream smoke and no ash.  While not calling it a fire safe cigarette, he notes that Merit with Paper Select was less likely to ignite certain fabrics and if left unattended was more likely to extinguish itself than cigarettes with regular paper.  He is questioned about why it had taken so long for this product to be developed.

He talks about R.J.Reynolds' strengths and weaknesses, his vision for the company and what is needed to implement that vision.  He points to problems confronting RJR including an acceleration in the rate of decline of smokers, an increase in prices by Philip Morris, an increase in state excise taxes, a decline in the social acceptability of smoking, the aging of the RJR customer base, their customers switching to competitors' lower priced brands, and trade loading.  He cites RJR's strengths including an increase in young adults smoking Camel, Doral and Magna, effective sports marketing, excellent direct marketing, the technological capability of Tobaccoville and Whittaker Park, and computer resources.  He wants to change the corporate culture, be more responsive to consumers, have tighter quality control, and support the freedom of people to choose to smoke.
