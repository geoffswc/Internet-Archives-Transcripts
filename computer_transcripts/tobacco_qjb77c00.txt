good afternoon everybody, thanks for coming down on such short notice and also welcome everybody here in the cafeteria 120 Park would also those who are on p.m. TV and watching us and as well as some people around the world who are on just an audio feed with me today are Bill Webb are two Operating Officer Chuck wall or general counsel and Mike semantic president/ceo of Philip Morris USA as Bill will mention just a few minutes Jeff obviously would be here but he is out of the country and Bill, here representing Jeff each one of those three gentlemen will have a few things to say bill is going to deliver some remarks that Jeff wrote Because he wanted for everybody to hear what he was feeling today Chuck is going to explain what has happened what the next steps are and try to give everybody a sense of why we feel pretty good about our chances are feel very good about our chances of having this thing reversed ultimately, I'm on a peel and then Mike is going to say a few things I'll come back real quickly at the end of that for a couple of comments and then we'll take your questions so without further Ado Chief Operating Officer Philip Morris companies go web, thank you Steve good afternoon good evening everybody Jeff is in fact on his way back here he didn't leave this afternoon when he heard the verdict although one might be tempted to do that he he's on his way back he was on an overseas business trip with the long-standing commitment so he's asked me to read these comments which he had planned to give in the event that this unfortunate verdict came out, as you may have guessed we are here to talk about the angle jury decision in the verdict in the amount of one hundred and forty five billion dollars against the industry and seventy four billion dollars against Philip Morris in a few moments I'm going to ask Chuck wall to give you some details about the verdict what happens next and while we why we feel so positive about the future of this particular case, but before he does I'd like to give you my perspective of where we are and it's reflective of what I said in the desk drop we issued immediately after the after the verdict came out which was about an hour or so ago, it is an understatement to say that this is not a good verdict, but it is not a surprise either and I can assure you that in typical Philip Morris fashion we prepared for every possibility that we could think of, those of you who have followed this case know that the deck seem to be stacked against us from the very start rulings went against us on a remarkably consistent basis before and throughout the trial and I am certain the aim of the Court was to get us to settle this case, well we didn't settle and we won't settle because the law is on our side we intend and we expect to get through this and be Vindicated in the end, it might take a long time because of the lengthy nature of the judicial process but we will eventually get there, we will launch our appeal as soon as the Florida law permits Chuck will explain in more detail about that in just a few moments, I'm not going to pretend that the post verdict and appeal process is going to be smooth and easy I expect there will be events and Court decisions that we will not be happy about but at the end of the day whenever that day comes and it will we will finally be free of this class action case and we will emerge Victorious and stronger than before, I can't thank you enough for sticking with us through this tortuous litigation I am sure they were mornings when some of you woke up and asked yourselves when will it ever end, believe me I had plenty of those mornings myself, so please continue to stick with us have confidence in our ability to work through it and focus on where we expect to come out, to you and to your families whom I'm sure felt some moments of anxiety reading about the case in the newspapers I want to express my deepest appreciation for your support I'm sure it has not been easy for many of you or them, I'm sure they were times when it was extremely difficult wondering what all this meant to the company especially when we were under a gag order that prevented us from speaking to you, but you've made it through this difficult period with flying colors I might add given the state of our businesses and you are with us today for that I'm extremely grateful thank you each and every one of you for having confidence in us and making sure our businesses stayed humming and moving forward and now let me turn it over to Chuck to explain the legal situation in more detail Chuck, thank you very much bill before I get into the trying to explain what I must say is a rather complicated process but I will do my very best to explain it to you let me tell you a little bit some of the things that this verdict is not the result of, first of all it's not the result of the testimony of Mike semantics and Ellen Merlot who are terrific it is they went down to the arena as I call it down there and I think Dan web calls it and talked about Philip Morris the company today and talked about the employees of Philip Morris they were absolutely terrific, it is not about Dan web and a wonderful team he put together with his law firm of Winston's Tron they were absolutely spectacular, and it is not about the efforts of the in-house lawyers here particularly John mode Eric and Greg Little who have worked so hard on this case for so long and have done an absolutely terrific job, those people are to be congratulated although they don't ask for congratulations and we owe them a real debt of gratitude although they don't seek it because of the time and the effort they put in on our behalf, what is verdict is in my judgement is the result of a very badly flawed process, we are the victims of it and I believe the jury is the victim of it as well, and as a lawyer I must say that I'm embarrassed about a system that is so flawed and a judge who I must say is been so biased, this is not just a tobacco issue, it is an issue that involves all of us who are interested in a judicial system that is fair and a fair process it is about every corporation who is interested in a fair and just judicial system, now this may sound like somebody complaining about a very bad result in part it probably is but I think we have a great deal of justification, it is actually a verdict in favor of no one as Dan web and billmeyer have said today because the class members are unknown, we do not know who will be participating in this verdict in the award today because they have not been identified and their cases have yet to be tried, that is a process that could take many many years, and there's one of the reasons I believe the process is so flawed, we have said before that the certification of this class was wrong, 28 out of 31 cases have been found not to be susceptible to class certification in state and federal courts in this country 28 out of 30 one decisions and the three decisions are the Engel case which we are in the process of right now the burrowing case which was the etas case we settled some years ago and a case pending in Louisiana, in every other instance when the courts have addressed the issue of whether a class should be certified in a smoking and health case the courts have said no that is a further indication of why this is a flawed process, it is a flawed process because the judge himself is a member of the class, the case in the case in which he has been sitting and he refused to remove himself from the case, it is a flawed process because it defies common sense and the law to have a punitive damage damage has decided in a some of this amount before a single case has been tried of class members other than the three that were tried earlier this year a single case of hundreds of thousands of class members have been tried to determine whether we're liable to anyone else, and yet punitive damages have been set in a lump sum, the size of this verdict is a absurd in my judgment it is the largest in the history of the American judicial process no company is Bill Omar said many countries could never possibly pay such an award, it is not the result of a full and fair trial based on all the evidence, it was the result of a trial of three hand-picked individual cases, but even there, when those cases were tried if you'll recall one case was thrown out because they failed to bring the case in time, and in all three of the cases that were tried and upon which this punitive damage verdict is based the plane tickets were found by this jury to be more at fault than Philip Morris, when the percentage of fault was allocated in each of the three cases that have been tried to date, three members of the class cases have been tried those playing keys were found more at fault than Philip Morris when the fault was allocated among the plaintiffs and defendants, now I ask you how can a defendant be found liable for 74 billion dollars when in the cases that were tried to plant these were found more at fault in the defendant, and this trial that me tell you was about the past I do not believe for an instant it's a comment on the present or the future Mike is going to have more to say about that in a few moments, okay now what happens that's the issue of the day, and let me tell you what the procedure is although judge Kaye has defied my descriptions in the past I'm going to try to tell you what the law requires first of all this award should be greatly reduced and that will be one of the first motions we will be making, and this was all going to take place beginning Monday when we go before judge Kaye again and set out an orderly procedure in which we're going to deal with this case going into the future, it is our position that under Florida law no final judgment can be entered in this case and that's why I said it really is an award to no one, nothing can be entered no money can be collected no money can be demanded because all of the issues in this case have not been decided, so that's the first thing we will establish, second we are going to file what we call the post-trial motions and these are the Motions that are filed in all cases in which we are going to ask judge Kaye to set aside these verdicts as being against the weight of the evidence we're going to ask judge Kaye to say that for find that there have been so many errors committed in this case that the verdicts should be set aside, now I will be candid with you we have been before judge Kaye many times on motions similar to this and we have been unsuccessful, my pretty well educated guess is that we're going to be unsuccessful again judge Kaye I don't think is going to listen to us when we talk about the errors of this case, if we are unsuccessful we should begin phase 3 of the case and phase 3 of the case consists of the trials of the remaining class members all 500 to 700 thousand of them and that again tells you how absurd this procedure is for by the estimate of most of the observers of this case if 100 judges in the State of Florida were assigned to these cases full-time and the cases, generally as long as smoking and health cases take we would be well into our 80th year before we concluded these cases that is why I say this is an absurd result and a deeply flawed process, it will it would be at that time at the end of all those trials when a final judgment could be entered under Florida law, now while this is going on, and if this is the route this court and this case take, we will try to appeal on an interim basis it's called an interlocutory appeal before final judgment you try to go up to the court of appeals to see if the court of appeals will intervene we think there are extraordinary reasons why a court of appeals ought to intervene to prevent this Fiasco from continuing and from these cases taking up the time of the courts in the State of Florida for the next 80 years, but we are by no means guaranteed that the court will the appellate courts will intervene so the question is what happens if they do not what happens if a final judgment is entered by judge Kaye contrary to Florida law, well first we have a bonding cap in place with the recently enacted Federal Florida statute which in this case places a cap on the bomb that must be posted of 100 million dollars and we will be prepared to put post that Bond and what that bond does in the event of final judgment is entered is it stays execution of that judgment the plaintiff cannot go out and Levy against your assets can't go, and Levy against your bank accounts can't go out and gather in your property and sell it and that prevents that from happening while you go up on appeal to the Florida courts so it stays execution of the Judgment it has nothing to do with the right to appeal we have a right to appeal of a final judgment is entered but it does stay execution and then we would appeal all of the issues in this case that we feel so strongly about that have been airs in this case for the past two years, yes including the certification issue this case should not have been certified as a class including the punitive damage issue there is no basis upon which to find a lump sum punitive damage award before finding compensatory damages or liability and all of the numerous legal errors that judge Kaye has committed during the course of this trial I believe with all of my heart then we have a very good chance of success on appeal, if ever there has been a good chance of success on appeal this is one where I believe we should win, we have had as you know considerable success on appeal in the past castano chip alone the numerous courts of appeals that have ruled in our favor in the third party payor cases it is in the appellate courts where we have had a good deal of success, this is all going to be take some time and I'm sorry to say that but it's going to take that time and I don't know how much time it's going to take it could be a matter of weeks more likely a matter of months before all this is sorted out and the Appellate process is clear judge Kaye has not acted as I said in the past exactly in line with Florida law and therefore we have to expect almost any eventuality and as you may imagine we are prepared for it, I want to emphasise that this case involves only Philip Morris USA and not the other operating companies something I think there is a tendency to lose sight of occasionally in the media I also want to emphasize as I've just said that our record in class actions is extremely good 28 out of 30 1 decisions in our favor, and I emphasize also that the industry has just tried to individual cases the Nunley case and the Anderson case and in those individual cases when you have an opportunity to present your case before a jury and all the evidence comes in at one time we have had a remarkable degree of success and that is what I mean by a fair process and not a flawed process, what is clear from this case I think is that the company is moving in the right direction with terrific leadership and speaking of terrific leadership let me introduce Mike semantics, thank you thanks Chuck and Steve and Bill, here I am fresh from Miami I spent the last week in Miami and in the courtroom that you some of you may have seen on TV a little while ago, you would think that having spent a week in Miami in that courtroom and listening after having spent three days on the witness stand in Miami testifying that in a circumstance that happened here just a minute or two ago few minutes ago and Steve Parrish and I, were waiting for this this this opportunity to talk to you to begin and we were approached and asked if we would like some makeup that Steve Parrish would have treated we treated me with at least some level of respect instead what he did was he he responded for both of us by saying well I really don't need any makeup, and you don't have enough makeup to help my commands, I want to thank you very much, so that Steve I really appreciate it I'll think of you the next time I'm on the witness stand being cross-examined I just want to make a couple of comments I'm not going to repeat what you've heard from Chuck and and Bill and I hope so you got to watch the press conference and see Bill I'll wire comment and I think they've given you the the legal background, here I think is appropriate for you to now I just want to comment a little bit about what what I believe our job is and why I think it's important that we continue to do it I have to tell you that that having spent eight days in the in the courtroom I believe that the the jury in this case was given an enormously difficult task today is, I don't in any way discredit this this jury they worked very hard I believe they were asked to do an extraordinary difficult thing in a fair environment that would be would be terribly hard to do if it was a fair environment and that's to really cast their eyes of today back over 50 years and try and make a determination about decisions people make, things people did in history that was in a different time and to ask them to do that in what was I believe in unfair environment made it I think virtually impossible for them to really look at this and come to what I believe would have been a fair judgement so I don't discredit them in any way and I think that, you need to all understand that that this verdict is not a reflection of this company today and how this company operates it is not a reflection of what you do and how you go about doing your work it is not a reflection of any indication that we are not doing the right things in the way we conduct ourselves in this business and fact I can tell you that yesterday and the plaintiffs attorneys closing, remarks he went out of his way out of his way to tell this jury that they should not and could not, make their determination on this award based on what they heard about how we conduct our business today, because he didn't want them to do that he didn't want them to do a review of what they had seen about how we conduct our business today he wanted them only to do a review of what he had allowed them to look at relative to past history and try to guess, how that history unfolded in a time that they were never apart of so I think it's very important for all of us that we understand that we have to go forward not and the conduct of this business accomplish the mission that we have laid out for Philip Morris USA and continue to mean maintain a very tight focus on that mission and the core values that we've established for the company, because, as you as you think about the future, I think what you want to have in your head is that if ever this circumstance occurs again 20 30 40 years from now, and some group of people some six jurors are asked, to look at the things that we did in our conduct of the business today and tomorrow and next week and next month, that when they look it is Crystal Clear to them, it is Crystal Clear to them, if the conduct that they see then, was right conduct that the way we go about operating this business today will be looked at it people by people in the future and we want them to look at it and say that that company, that company today and that company been was the most responsible company that we can see in America that that company made very good decisions about how they went about operating a business knowing that it was a difficult business and knowing that they manufacture the product that carries with it risk, so that there's no question in anybody's mind that's what the mission of this Corporation is intended to do that's what our values mean that's what you and I, have a cigar, now I have a I have a lot of confidence in Chuck wall, I have a lot of confidence and the internal lawyers in this company of a an extraordinary amount of confidence in the legal team that defended us they're very disappointed but they are Extraordinary People they're very dedicated to this company they feel very good about the company that they're defending I had an opportunity to gather them all together night before last because we knew that we would like to like to get a verdict, and I wanted the opportunity to tell them how much we appreciate it all the hard work that they've done for us and I have to tell you they're there just like you they're enormously proud people are proud to be associated with Philip Morris the proud to be depending Philip Morris they're very proud of the way we conduct ourselves in the way we carry out our business they were very excited to have the opportunity to understand the things that we're doing to understand our mission, mission and how we're carrying it out and they're they're truly extraordinary people and I told them that and I have a great deal of confidence in them as we continue on through this process, I also even though I'm a bit disappointed by the experience that I had in this Miami courtroom I will tell you I do have the utmost faith in the judicial system in this country and I believe that ultimately we will get a fair hearing on this and that we are right and correct in our position and the things that that Chuck told you, and most importantly I want you to know that as I spent countless hours sitting down in Miami the thing that Boyd my, the thing that allows me to stand before you today with with the utmost confidence about this company's future and where we're going and what we're doing is all you it's thinking about all of you and all of the great things that you do each and every day and what find people you are, just really terrific hard-working honest people with great integrity, and I don't want you for one second allow yourself to think that this verdict says anything about you other than that you're terrific and you're doing right things you are, and it makes me feel really good when we get bad news to think about you, and that's why I'm here and will continue to be here, so it is what it is I've been telling people for some time now there are potholes in the road this is pretty good-sized pot hole, okay but there are potholes in the road this is going to be the only one, but I'll tell you what we're in a different place and we were two and a half years ago and two and a half years from now we'll be even in a better place than we are today, and so we just keep on driving down the road, and we'll hit some potholes, and if we break an axle will get out to fix it keep on going, thank you very much, before we do the Q&A I just wanted to make a couple of observations on my own behalf you know from time to time it's my privilege to speak on behalf of the company on behalf of the people of Philip Morris but today I want to speak on my own behalf, I thought I was prepared for this and I had I thought I'd prepared myself for even a bigger verdict than we got but I got to tell you when I heard when I sat there in the conference room and watch it on TV I wasn't prepared for it and my guess is there a lot of you who were in the same situation, but in the same Spirit of honesty I want to tell you that I really am confident about our ability to have this case reversed I really believe that we definitely will prevail in this lawsuit I also feel great about this company in the future of this company we are on the right track with p.m. 21 we are doing the right thing we are not going to back down we are, this for the Long Haul because we are the people of Philip Morris and we will be there forever I've worked for Philip Morris for 10 years and before that I represented Philip Morris for a little over 10 years and I've got to tell you that in light of everything that's happened I have never been as proud as I am today to be employee of Philip Morris we are on the right track and we will get to where we need to be
