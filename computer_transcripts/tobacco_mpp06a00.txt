good morning this hearing of the house committee on agriculture to review the tobacco quota by out will come to order today we convene the full committee on agriculture to review Concepts surrounding a tobacco quota by out we will hear testimony from four separate panels consisting of members of Congress tobacco producers,tobacco product manufacturers and health groups each panel will offer its own unique perspective on the problems faced by the American Tobacco industry and how it Tobacco quota by out may help the same way each individual panelists will bring his or her own particular view to the debate ultimately there will be agreement and disagreement among the panels and among the individual panelist it is important that we the members of the committee here both the American, co-producer is I'm sure we'll all agree subject to intense pressures that substantially impede his or her own ability to maintain a profitable farming operation for one factors affecting the profitability of us tobacco product manufacturers essentially trickled down to negatively impact the individual tobacco farm more importantly though American Tobacco producers find themselves trapped within an outdated federal price support system which limits Supply and raises the, so u.s. tobacco above competitive international market levels drastic Cuts in Quota levels over the past several years have dramatically raised the cost of producing u.s. tobacco which has in turn exacerbated it's already high price as that price has risen domestic and foreign manufacturers have increasingly turned to foreign tobacco leaf which has only served to squeeze the American Tobacco farmer even more we can also stipulate that u.s. tobacco product manufacturers face, is a mountain of challenges to their ability to remain profitable over the past several years they have endured a variety of lawsuits holding them liable for disease and death extensive efforts by health organizations some of whom are represented here today to persuade people not to smoke and ever-increasing federal and state excise taxes on Tobacco products the 1998 Master settlement agreement obligates participating manufacturers to pay two hundred and six billion dollars over 25 years, there's two states on their own accord manufacturers committed to pay five point one five billion over 12 years to growers in order to comply these companies have been forced to raise the price of cigarettes by as much as 51 cents per pack these developments collectively impose an extremely high level of financial liability on Tobacco product manufacturers that has translated into higher product costs and sharply declining sales, over the past several years many have advocated a buyout of tobacco quota as a possible step that could have could be taken by Congress to help alleviate some of the burdens faced by domestic tobacco product manufacturers and tobacco Growers supporters specifically argue that a tobacco quota buyout would release the individual tobacco farmer from the smothering constraints of a current federal price support system, the consequent removal of soaring quota rent would substantially lower the cost of production of American Tobacco enabling domestic Farmers to Market It For Less this in turn would make American Tobacco more price competitive on the World Market allowing the domestic grower to re-establish previously lost market share both at home and abroad on the surface there is a parent consensus within the tobacco Community concerning the need for a tobacco quota by out manufacturers and Growers, have passionately debated a variety of proposals for how to achieve one over the past several years there has even been a willingness among the tobacco Community to engage our friends from the Health Community who are committed to advocating against the use of tobacco products in dialogue about how they may help in bringing a buyout to fruition although much progress had been made in the tobacco quota by out debate I suspect there is still much work to be done many convincing proposals, this'd that outline detailed plans for how to achieve a buyout and in some cases how to shape post by out tobacco policy but many questions remain unresolved how much money truly amounts to Fair compensation for quota holders if a buyout should occur should Growers receive compensation as well if so how much and why who should be who should pay for a quota by out if tobacco product manufacturers should do they agree, are they willing are they able how should post tobacco policy most post by out tobacco policy be formulated would some sort of new program be needed could those who want to continue to farm tobacco do so without one what's more important the money or the ability of a grower to continue producing after a buyout takes place is FDA regulation of tobacco products really an acceptable compromise in return for, or a buyout if so which kind of FDA regulation is acceptable which kind isn't would a buyout be worth it if FDA were in return allowed to regulate the American Tobacco industry out of existence what are the consequences of that these are the types of questions we must not just Ponder casually we must ask them and answer them directly there is one more notion upon which I think we can all agree that is achieving a buyout of tobacco quota in the you, House of Representatives is no piece of cake in order to help better the prospects for a buyout the committee on agriculture must uncover precisely what a buyouts prospects are right now the testimony we received today will prove integral in our ability to fairly and accurately assess where we are and more importantly what we need to work on in the tobacco buyout debate only then will be able to decipher the all-important question of where to go from here, I welcome all of you to today's hearing I'm going to recognize the gentleman from Texas mr. stenholm the ranking member and then also the chairman and ranking member of the specialty crops subcommittee for opening statements other opening statements will be made a part of the record and because of the very lengthy list of Witnesses were then going to move to our first panel but this time it is my pleasure to recognize the gentleman from Texas mr. Stein home thank you mr. chairman and thank you for your opening statement a very clear and concise, of what we hope to accomplish beginning with this hearing today and I'd also like to thank the many witnesses who have come many cases many great distances to be here for this hearing and to share your thoughts and ideas is how a consensus might ultimately be developed the purpose of this hearing is you're all aware is to discuss the tobacco program and the various proposals regarding the tobacco quote mbeya tobacco program was established in the 1930s as a means of, controlling production and stabilizing the price of tobacco it is served tobacco Farmers well for over the years however now as we did with peanuts in the farm bill tobacco farmers are looking at a change what we're being asked to consider is no small matter because it involves altering in one way or another the manner in which the tobacco program has operated and affected Farmers for over 60 years as I'm sure most of you are aware there are a number of legislative proposals that seek they're, all a buyout of tobacco quotas and though these proposals may all have the same goal the mechanisms they use for achieving that goal and what they propose to do after the goal is achieved varies greatly that is why I'm glad to see what we have a wide range of panels present today representing the Growers the manufacturers and the health groups these are the groups that have been instrumental in bringing this issue to the Forefront and must ultimately be part of a solution it is important, for each of the panels to listen to each other just as those of us on the committee will be listening and looking and hopefully finding that consensus package that will ultimately find the necessary 218 votes 51 votes and presidential signature I look forward to hearing from the witnesses that will testify before this committee today it is my hope that this hearing will not be not only be informative but also provide the insights into the Myriad issues surrounding, production of tobacco and the rural communities that depend on it thank you once again mr. chairman I thank the gentleman it's now my pleasure to recognize the chairman of the specialty crop subcommittee who has worked very hard on this issue the gentleman from Tennessee mr. Jenkins thank you mr. chairman and I thank you for convening this hearing and I too like the ranking member would commend you on making a very accurate portrayal of the situation that confronts us, us in your opening statement the subject of this hearing has many interested parties and each category is entitled to and I hope has been invited to be heard the primary concern for many of us are the families that own allotments and grow tobacco, many families who have engaged in this agricultural activity which has a Heritage that began in colonial days and was a Mainstay of the economy of many of the colonies are aging and profitability is not what it used to be, these Hardy Americans can contend with both these conditions but cannot withstand the fury that has been Unleashed against this particular commodity while ignoring or even encouraging the use of others whose impact is far more harmful and expensive to individuals in our society lawsuits and political correctness of bound, and seem to be replacing common sense and good judgment as forces that got us we have reached the point where the tobacco Community must have relief I hope that at the end of this process those with property rights can receive the compensation to which they are entitled and those who continue to farm tobacco will not see yet another industry driven from our Shores, resulting in the loss of farm income farm jobs manufacturing income manufacturing jobs and billions of dollars in tax revenue that flows to the states of our Union while witnessing the importation of perhaps a more harmful version of the same product if this happens it leaves us in the confusing posture of having eliminated all of the benefits of this agricultural Endeavor while leaving, all of the detriment with us mr. chairman I look forward to hearing these Witnesses and to working with this committee to devise a remedy to this dilemma thank you, I think gentlemen it's now my pleasure to recognize the gentleman from North Carolina mr. McIntyre who is the ranking member of the specialty crop subcommittee and the author of one of the many pieces of legislation that addresses this issue John was right thank you mr. chairman I'd like to thank you and mr. stenholm for holding this hearing on this legislation that is so critical to the future of tobacco farmers and the tobacco industry in America I'd also like to thank mr. Jenkins our colleagues mr. Fletcher and, drift which he'll good Coble Kingston and others who have worked so hard to help move this process forward I look forward to continuing our work together, mr. chairman and my colleagues the future is now it is time for this uncertainty to end our farmers and Families Our communities and tobacco growing areas are the companies are friends in the Health Community indeed our nation is ready for the uncertainty surrounding tobacco to end the battle over what to do with tobacco program does not need to go on and on and that's why I do appreciate very much your willingness to bring everyone together today never before, we seen such unanimity among Farmers regarding what to do about the future of tobacco we do agree now and we have moved forward in the past year and a half to show that about is needed and it's needed now the farmers their families the communities that we represent across the tobacco belt depend upon tobacco as a means to support their way of life and the future of tobacco is so important not only to my district but to so many other districts represented here today and to those who have come to depend on the income generated from tobacco farming, that it is time to move forward as you mentioned I had the opportunity to introduce the first comprehensive buyout Legislation during the last session of Congress and I reintroduce this same bill designated hr:140 on the very first day of this year's session of Congress this legislation promoted the eight and for that we're all familiar with as now have other pieces of legislation as well eight dollars per pound for the quota owners four dollars per pound for tobacco Growers who want to continue growing tobacco based on the 1998, yay growing year for quote owners and 2001 for Growers this bill provides a way to pay for a buyout without raising taxes and dos call for FDA regulation not of Farms or Farmers but only for the manufacture and sale of tobacco products it also provides a way to eliminate federal price supports for tobacco freeing up revenue for agriculture programs in other parts of our country and other agricultural programs in general throughout the country including, in our areas as well while still providing an orderly economic transition away from the current price support system as you know last September we had a hearing In This Very Room we had the opportunity to put 10,000 signatures of Farmers on that very table saying they were ready for a buyout the this bill has 20 bipartisan co-sponsors including members from each of the major tobacco producing states, I'm so excited today that we can now all come together ready to move forward as the ranking member of the subcommittee on specialty crops and as a member of this committee I look forward to working with everyone in this room and I mean that sincerely so that we can reach a compromise to support to keep to Garner the support of our entire agriculture committee and yes the Full House of Representatives as we come together to do this today I hope you will remember that in our effort in good faith, it was the week before Palm Sunday back before Easter that we put a discussion draft on the table in an attempt to bring the best of all the pieces of legislation we're going to hear about today to deal with what needs to be done to move forward with the tobacco buyout from dealing with the cost of the buyout the production controls and price support what will happen with WTO the implications on public health what this means to non-tobacco producing states and even the financial burden that the companies May face we want to put it all on the table so we can now move forward together, other in closing let me say that I hope that when we're finished today that will not be worn out and tired but actually will all be fired up to get going to get this thing done to bring all parties together our Farmers our families our tobacco communities deserve nothing less I say sincerely I look forward to working with all of you and accomplishing this goal indeed it is time for the uncertainty to end we can all talk all day about different, Isis but I trust that those testifying today as well as others in the room who have a stake in this will share how they will commit to achieve our common goal of getting the tobacco by out legislation done I'm ready to do that I trust were already and God willing we can do it the time is now and I thank you mr. chairman I thank the gentleman this time we would like to welcome our first panel, The Honorable Ernie Fletcher member of Congress from Kentucky and The Honorable Jack Kingston member of Congress from Georgia and vice chairman of the house Republican conference I'd like to welcome both of you advise you that your full statement will be made a part of the record and first recognize Congressman Fletcher who is also the author of legislation addressing this issue thank you chairman Goodlett and appreciate you and ranking members 10 home holding this hearing we also appreciate, chairman of the specialty crop chairman Jenkins ranking member McIntyre we certainly appreciate your work and Leadership on this and other colleagues I've worked with specifically representative Etheridge and Lucas we thank you for your all's work on this very important legislative initiative, last September I had the opportunity to share with you the situation of our tobacco Farmers that situation is worsened since that time in our part of the country the quotas are as low as they've been since 1874, since that time we've had constructive dialogue that's taken place between members Farmers farmer organization manufacturers and public health groups and I greatly appreciate their participation at this hearing today today you may hear a near consensus that a buyout is necessary or at least acceptable in some form however there will be a healthy discussion on the particular details of the reform I would like to use my time today to briefly address some of the most common questions about it too, could buy up the question I'm perhaps most often asked about a buyout is how much with a buyout cost any buyout will be drafted to conform to the budget agreement and should score zero just as the current tobacco program is not supported with treasury money the de Vaca buyout should be privately funded currently both hr:140 mr. McIntyre's bill when HR 245 the bill iFile assess about 2.3 billion, Ian dollars a year over nine years is also worth noting that the average individual payment in a buyout based on 8 and 4 and 99 or 1998 poundage paid over five years is about 12 and a half percent less than the average annual farm bill payment to a program participant there are some questions additionally about the WTO implications of a buyout most by ah proposals make decoupled payments based on historic ownership patterns and should be constituted as green box, payments under WTO rules while there is uncertainty is whether some master settlement agreement Phase 2 payments may be Amber box such as North Carolina which has made payments based on each Year's production by out should eliminate such concerns because a buyout would supersede phase two payments also the current program is not classified by the WTO because it is a no net crossed structure which would not change for future production, after a buyout the issue that maybe most discussed today regards have a post by out Market should look there are some concerns voiced about quote selling the truck and driving at home but such concerns are misplaced any post by out Market that eliminates quota will be radically different from the 1942 2003 Federal tobacco program any buyout will eliminate about 326,000 people from tobacco production, leaving at most the 90,000 current producers more importantly farmers will be able to receive the full value of their crop the external value of paying rent to participant to participate in growing tobacco is eliminated to suggest the elimination of the right to sell and Lease quota is anything less than a fundamental change to the way tobacco is grown in this country is inaccurate at the same time the stability of tobacco supply is a common concern of producers manufacturers, and public health groups are farmers need some form of production control to keep tobacco grown in traditional growing areas to prevent disastrous overproduction and to maintain an adequate supply for the manufacturers stability is also in the interest of Public Health to maintain predictability and quality standards as well as to avoid the impoverishment of our rural communities that have long been dependent upon tobacco but production for their Commerce what a farm bill continues to provide significant income and price, four other major Commodities that is likely to backhoes one opportunity to in controversial program and provides support for current and future tobacco Farmers as well as the rural communities throughout the southeast that depend upon them all of this can be done while improving Public Health protection for Americans while tobacco product regulation is not an issue in this committees jurisdiction it is certainly related to the buyout question it has been said it's likely that a buyout will need a regulatory component to pass the Senate and many, up and any conference will likely include some FDA regulation of tobacco products moving forward on legislation will depend on the degree of commitment to progress of many of those testifying today there is no doubt that the agricultural committee and its leadership care about tobacco farmers and their plight and about building a healthier nation and we certainly appreciate that concern it seems that we have begun to make progress, but our Farmers cannot wait we have a unique window of opportunity to pass meaningful program reform I respect would respectfully request of you in all the parties involved in the process today to work to build on the developing consensus for a buyout and above all work to be ready for action on this critical issue soon after the August recess together with the input from today's hearing we must work to improve current proposals to provide adequate compensation for the relief of a quote, Equity transition payments and public health protection while providing a framework to ensure stability for Growers after quota is eliminated in closing I'd like to also thank Bill O'Connor and the agricultural committee staff for their hard work and dedication to this issue and certainly my gratitude to everyone here today for honoring my request to testify thank you mr. chairman, thank you Congressman Fletcher I'm now pleased to welcome Congressman Jack Kingston thank you mr. chairman and this is Stan how members of the committee it's good to be back here I was a member of this committee when kike delagarza was the chairman and served on it it's truly one of the great committees in the house and it's just good to be home also we've always been proud to have Georgians on here mr. Burns and mr. Scott right now doing a great job for us and wanted to say to mr. McIntyre mr. Etheridge I'm not, which one of you represents Wayne County but is it Goldsboro but we had a tobacco hearing there when I was on this committee mr. Rose was the chairman of the subcommittee and we've been working on Tobacco you know since I've been in Congress because it is such an important commodity to the state of Georgia in my district alone I represent 29 counties tobacco is grown in 22 of them and it has a farm gate, value of 69 million dollars mr. Burns also has a lot of tobacco so does mr. bishop and mr. Norwood when tobacco Farmers have a bad year the whole town the whole County and the whole Region's have bad years this government made the decision I'd say 200 years ago that tobacco was a good thing it's as evidenced by the tobacco leaves that are on the columns in the capital which most people don't even recognize the, tobacco leaves but from a mission statement of saying let's grow tobacco let's export it let's tax it lets depend on it for a good Revenue stream to in the last 10 years saying tobacco as a bad thing and yet we've changed our mind rural economies can't transition that quickly that's why I believe the tobacco buyout is so very important again when tobacco Farmers have a bad year it affects the entire, areas I have submitted my full statement for the record so I'm not going to read through it there are a lot of stories which we all have in our districts of the impact and the hardship at places on individual Farm families but I wanted to summarize the the four points that I think are important in terms of the bills which have all been offered and a lot of good committee work and informal committee work has taken place the things that I like in them would be first and foremost, eight dollars / for dollar buyout for our quota holders and I think most people are building the consensus that that is a good thing the other thing is to look at the quota cut situation last year flue-cured tobacco acreage in Georgia was twenty-six thousand five hundred acres are down 43,000 Acres since 1997 the acreage decrease was due to another decline in the basic flue-cured quota, and represent a huge reduction in farm income tobacco ranks third in the single crop income in Georgia with the value of flue-cured leaf decline in approximately 50 percent in six years I'm committed to do everything I can to help the farmers recover from quota quotes that they've had to deal with the third point that I want to emphasize is that I strongly believe that the biopsy based on the 1998 quota in, he ate Georgia Tobacco quota was 85 million pounds as of 2002 the quota has been cut to 60 million pounds so 85 million to 60 million pounds are a reduction of 25 million pounds based on an 84 by out this represents a difference of two hundred million dollars for quota owners and a difference of 100 million for growers in Georgia as you can see the 1998 by out represents a difference in the livelihood of tobacco Growers and, all the communities around them I'm strongly committed to that as I know many of the other Georgia members and other house members are as well and then finally I want to emphasize that I think often in this discussion we have left out the tobacco warehouseman in the state of Georgia in 1998 there were 23 Tobacco Warehouse has today there are only four and we've all been in tobacco warehouses you really can't do that much, else with it the the ventilation you can't turn it into retail you can't start selling cars in there you can have flea markets but these things are so huge how can you have a flea market on a regular basis enough to bring in income and I truly believe that we have to do something for the tobacco warehouseman because they have been devastated by all the changes in tobacco as well and the way the auctions have been done has certainly hurt them and I've, got things in my statement about that and I guess I wanted to make two other points mr. chairman this needs to happen is Dr Fletcher says in the year 2003 we've been talking about it for a long time the whole time that we're doing it more and more communities are losing revenues and going broke so we need to try to address this as soon as possible and I will say this as a member of the the egg subcommittee on Appropriations I want to do my part and then one final note the farmers in our area are, somewhat ambivalent about FDA regulation what they're telling I believe mr. Burns and me is hey we don't care we just want this thing done my caution to them though is if you start doing business with the FDA it's not just going to end it's going to be a permanent partnership and that partnership is one of dictation not one of cooperation so firstly speaking that I think we need to be real cautious about the FDA oversight and I've seen as we all, have that FDA depends on who's leading FDA at the time sometimes they're Pro tobacco sometimes they're not and that can be used as a hammer against them so those are my comments and mr. chairman and members of the committee I greatly appreciate everything you all are doing as Leaders on this issue I think both Congressman Kingston in Congressman Fletcher for your valuable contribution to this issue I want to take this opportunity also to acknowledge the presence in here, remove Congressman Ron Lewis a former member of the committee who is also very interested in this issue and who represents a district in Kentucky to which this issue is of great importance to many of his constituents as well so I thank all of you for your contribution today and we will move forward with the next panel thank thank you both, we'd now like to invite our second panel of witnesses to the table mr. Jeff Akin owner and operator of a can Farm of Telford Tennessee mr. John William Carter the third owner and operator of Carter Farms from Eagle Springs North Carolina mr. David Chapple owner and operator of Chapel farms in Owenton Kentucky mr. Donald more owner and operator of more Farms from Chatham Virginia mr. David Winkle's Jr president of South Carolina, Bureau from Columbia South Carolina and mr. Donald right owner and operator of right farm from Glade Spring Virginia, I'd like to welcome all of the members of the panel to advise you that your full written statement will be made a part of the record ask that you limit your remarks to 5 minutes given the large number of witnesses we have today and the great many members who would like to ask questions of you and we will begin with mr. Aiken welcome, mr. chairman committee members I'd like to thank you for the opportunity to share my views on an issue of vital importance to myself and my fellow producers in Tennessee times are tough on the farm for any commodity but there are some unique issues in the tobacco industry we have invested in a program operated under the restrictions and benefits of that same program and now find it crumbling you to necessary changes not being addressed, it is the question of how to address those changes that brings us here today, I'm a producer Burley tobacco and rely on that crop for a profitable Diversified farming operation we also produce corn and hay on our Dairy and beef cattle farm my 45-acre burly production is larger than average in Tennessee but there are many larger Growers across the state, while size of operation may affect the opinion toward by out proposals I believe I can include in the concerns of both larger and smaller Growers and quota owners in my comments in considering the range of concerns many about our future it is necessary and wise to look at our past as a young man and a strong tobacco community of East Tennessee I had a career decision to make some years ago and chose to engage in growing tobacco, the opportunities for a career change at this time are limited are limited for myself, I know no other legal crop that can provide the level of income that tobacco has traditionally afforded the farming operations in our state producers have made an investment in the production of tobacco through the no net calls program and it's related expenses in addition to the grading fees no net cost assessments marketing costs and normal production expenses there's another major non-value added expense I have to pay the cost of acquiring quota, to maintain sufficient levels of production to sustain my farming operation the quota Cuts over the past few years have greatly inflated this cost in 1998 the basic quota for Burley tobacco production in Tennessee was nearly 111 million pounds, in 2001 the basic quota for Tennessee Burley was less than fifty Seven million pounds obviously since quoted determines the ability to produce and sell are earning capability has been essentially cut in half since 1998 at a time when production costs continue to rise our production is reduced and quote availability is limited resulting in increased quota least cost added to the economics of this situation is to quote a buyout debate, the continuing discussion about a buyout and the inability to plan ahead because of that discussion has greatly complicated efficient production or the orderly transfer of growing rods from historical quota owners to current tobacco Growers as I steep State Board member of the Tennessee Farm Bureau Federation I'm contacted by various producer and quota on it owner interest and hopefully have a broader Viewpoint of the buyout discussion as a result of that contact, there's little argument that quote owners have an asset one that has affected land values in our state historically and Growers have a valid argument that without their production of that asset it would no longer have a value the argument makes very evident the need for a buyout or Finance transition from what we now have in a program to whatever follows the whatever follows needs to receive adequate attention or we might achieve something far worse than we can now only, the current program is not serving the needs of the producer or the buying segments of the industry the general public and particularly the health health advocacy groups apparently want some type of verifiable controls on Tobacco production it would seem production controls conserve the risk management needs of the industry better than becoming an economic burden to government support, I cannot in a very short statement outline a suitable replacement for the existing tobacco program although I think HR 245 is made inadequate attempt at describing of suitable framework I would expect some changes will need to be made to HR to 45 or to any piece of legislation as it moves through debate however I ask you to consider my situatin and many like mine I need to be able to produce for the available tobacco market I ask for your support	 the concepts including in h.r. 245 and would like to thank you again for giving me the opportunity to address you today	 thank you mr. Aiken mr. Carter welcome thank you mr. chairman members of the committee thank you for the invitation and privilege to speak before you today I'm Billy Carter a tobacco farmer from Moore County in North Carolina which is in the south central region of our state in addition to my farming I've had the opportunity to serve in leadership positions in various Farm organizations over the last several years and in the immediate past president of the tobacco growers association of North Carolina	 one of the first trips are made to Capitol Hill was in 1998 to encourage the passage of an eight dollar for quota owner and for dollar for producer per pound by out of the federal tobacco program as has been the case since 1997 and tobacco producing states the prospects for the foreseeable future or not as bright as one want them to be in fact they are stem as they ever have been	 if for a moment as a grower of flu cured tobacco you can forget the crushing impact of a 50% decline in Quota you would still find yourself saddled with more than your share of issues to caused Great concern about your future in this industry	 severe weather increased cost of production contractual sales of tobacco declining exports due to our lack of competitiveness threatened FDA regulation and multi-billion dollar lawsuits are all playing out against the backdrop of the most vigorously anti-tobacco political climate in history	 however Growers cannot forget the impact of a 50% reduction in Quota in the year 2003 our farmers are producing the smallest crop in the history of the federal program	 the devastating results are the same as it would be if any other small business was mandated to produce only half of its capacity despite its debt load or its capacity capability to produce a desirable crop tobacco Farms are no less than multiple small businesses interspersed in some of the most economically deprived rural areas in the nation the pain of our current situation is tobacco Farmers is made doubly difficult because it affects not only our families but the larger Community as well	 it would be presumptuous to assume that I knew how every participant in the industry feels about a vial of tobacco quota on thing that I can assure you of is that there is consensus among the vast majority of participants that are sweeping correction needs to be made to our current system of operation and that a quota by out is the quickest most effective vehicle to that end	 I am convinced that the status quo deliver an even greater blow to the business of tobacco farming in 2004 if a buyout is not achieved in my home state that correlates to widespread farm foreclosures in many elderly quota owners finding it impossible to sustain their most basic economic needs	 if done properly a quota by all the forces opportunity to address at least three to three critical areas in the tobacco Community First it offers a chance to contend with the issue surrounding and tobacco program that has remained virtually unchanged in 60 plus years secondly our quota by out could largely eliminate the Gap that exists in Economic Opportunity between our rural and urban sectors and of quota by Allah will give us the opportunity to compete in the Global Tobacco economy again	 there are structural issues within our program there are clearly inefficient however we are incapable of any major correction for fear of endangering The Fragile environment in which are Standalone commodity program exists we are afraid to overhaul obvious inadequacies or fear of losing the whole thing	 the second issue that our quota by out deals with concerns Bridging the Gap the disparity between our rural and urban sectors and the stabilizing the economy of our rural communities this inequity is receipt received great attention from our elected leaders their concern is Justified and the need is obvious and most of the rural sectors and small towns of tobacco producing states the financial weakness that exist in these rural areas is without question significantly attributable to the decline in tobacco	 Direction I can think of no one single thing that would Revitalize the rural economy of tobacco producing states any more effectively efficiently or thoroughly than a quota by out the third area that a quota by out offers us an unprecedented opportunity to address and deal with is our lack of competitiveness at an international level we should never forget that we are in a global context undeniably blessed with the best climate the most efficient infrastructure and	 the best understanding of how to produce the crop in a decent addition we are the safest most scrutinized most consistent and most politically stable producers of tobacco in the world the question is not will tobacco be grown but where will it be grown absent of by out the answer will soon be not in the United States we need to find a way to make these inherit advantages accrue to our benefit our problem is competitiveness and a lack of profitability	 we produce a product that is the Envy of the world but few can afford it our supply control program is the gold standard for all farm programs but it has failed to change in 60 plus years quota ownership has created economic stability and many rural areas but the rent factor in the cost of our tobacco has nearly crushed Us in the World Market we must find a way to compensate current quota owners for their production rights	 offer Growers of financial opportunity to make the transition to a new system transfer production or ice into the hands of actual producers and remove the value of those production rights from the cost of our tobacco	 ignore the opportunity that a quote about offers us to shake the status quo Revitalize our rural communities and break the death spiral of my new production levels would be an immense mistake	 obviously I am no expert on what is politically possible or practical I just know that if we do not have a biologist latian pass that we will continue to function for only a short period of time the industry will continue to atrophy and at some point in time we will be of so little consequence that we very well may have an end to the current program without compensation compensation or any method for transition	 the future of the US tobacco farm depends on the success of adequate legislation to provide the buyout this committee is considering any other efforts simply will fall short of the mark	 thank you mr. Carter mr. Chapel welcome	 mr. chairman members of the committee I want to take this opportunity to thank you for inviting me to make some brief comments on proposed buyout legislation while I understand this is the one of the many issues facing Congress it is only issue back home I can't walk through aunt in my home town in North Central Kentucky without being asked about it several times I farm about 2	200 acres in Owen County Kentucky I raise 50 acres of Burley Tobacco on 12 farms and Lease off of 17 other Farms I also	 over 200 paid cow-calf operation in nine acres case Alfalfa crop on County ranks third in Kentucky in tobacco dependency nearly 10% of the total personal income in Owen County is derived from tobacco production our primary alternative crop is beef cattle industry I want to express to all of you how excited and appreci I am too I am that you all have taken an interest in the plight of tobacco farmers and I know many others will talk about the hits we have taken so I want to go	 Oh in won't go into great detail but I will remind you that a 65% reduction in Quota is almost an equal reduction in tobacco farmer income I would like to give you the perspective of Nickelback about that I believe relates the hopes and concerns of majority of producers in my area of Kentucky put simply a by it is imperative to recreating a healthy Farm economy Kentucky but most producers who I talked to who are also very concerned about what the debauch of Market structure	 would look like when the biker by a payment stop coming most by it feels if passed would allocate payments over five to six year period many in my area wonder what will happen in the Civic year and Beyond when federal assistance ceases row cropping is not an option in my part of the state are ground is not flat rather it is hilly and farther east of me it is nearly mountains agriculture has only been a viable industry in Central and Eastern Kentucky because of the profitability	 up to of the dibakar crop likewise farmers in this region do not benefit much from farm bill payments except environmental assistance program	 because of the geographic penances I believe it is extremely important that the bike about legislation should prevent overproduction and at least make sure that the biker Growers who work hard to produce a good crop break even without those two components and most importantly A system that prevents overproduction I can assure you that the bike reproduction will leave my area in just a couple of years and we'll move to flatter ground west of us to put that Devastation into perspective for you taking tobacco production	 of Central and Eastern Kentucky would be similar to telling farmers in the midwest they can't grow corn or beans anymore	 I like most Farmers around me believe that HR 245 they tobacco hexley elimination act introduced by Congressman Ernie Fletcher is the best plan for Growers his plan of compensating quota owners and Growers based on the 1998 coating years and also creating new Tuvok system that is more in line with the World Market while also protecting American Tobacco producers it's one that I would hope to see pass while HR 245 is not currently married to	 DEA regulations of tobacco products most Growers are Kentucky would not oppose Fair regulation of tobacco products and if in conjunction with a tobacco by out-growers believe a tobacco about can only be accomplished if in conjunction with FDA regulation they are more concerned about getting the buyout then fighting off the FDA they do hope however the FDA line is will restrict the FDA from not having authority to regulate components of tobacco products that occur naturally	 naturally in the leaf production I understand there have been some questions raised about the dollar amount of HR 245 and also about the post Market structure created in it while I believe both the components are vitally important I want to let you know that I am like most Growers and willing to be flexible as we move through a debate I believe flexibility is key to bashing de Vaca by out legislation however if changes must be made how hope you would continue	 the challenges I've mentioned earlier in my tobacco producers through my many tobacco producers lastly let me say that I believe this is a year to pass it back about legislation recently Decisions by tobacco companies to completely forgo the auction market for flue-cured tobacco will likely be followed up with a similar decision for birth I know Congress has an aggressive agenda and I praise all of you for the work you have done to make this country safer place for all of us what a challenge you have faced and	 I believe you have worked relentlessly and marbly to defend this nation from those who wish to harm it it is imperative that you find some time in the counter this year to pass it to vodka by a bill that actually compensates the back of quota owners and Growers and protects those Growers who want to continue to produce de Vaca because I believed legislation is not passed this year the devastation is so heavily tobacco dependent region will be on the point of no return again thank you mr. chairman for this opportunity	 thank you miss Chapel mr. Moore we're pleased to have you with us I know you're here from my colleague Congressman goodes District yes good morning mr. chairman and members of the committee my name is Donnie Moore and I am from Chatham Virginia like to thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today I'm 46 years old I farmed the land my grandfather and father farmed before me my wife who works full time off the off the farm and I have twin 14 year old daughter's an 18 year old son had just graduated	 from high school operation consists of 25 acres of flue-cured tobacco approximately 75	000 pounds 90 brood cows 85 Acres of wheat around 30 Acres of: in 2002 we entered a contract with Purdue and constructed a poultry house holding 17	000 pullets even though we are considered Diversified we are still a very small family operation however we do have something in common with other larger Diversified operation	 actions that being that debacle generates the vast majority of our income in our case of proximate 70% is derived from dvaraka over half of the quota our producers rented from primarily retired Farmers or widowed Farm wise who consider this quota a retirement asset I purchased the rest of the quota and considered it to be an asset acquisition in the last six years we've seen our quotas or the production opportunity at for us Reduce by 46%	 both their income and mine has been reduced dramatically	 many of my non-farm neighbors can now relate to these reductions in Quota values with the value laws that they have suffered to their stocks bonds 401K plans in the last three years remember this quota is part of our retirement plan we in the debacle producing Community see no sustainable way out of a 50 year old program except for some sort of quote of compensation and producer transition payments simply stated Abaya	 we are trying to compete in a World Market with a product that is partially overpriced because of rent	 if the cost of quota could be eliminated with compensation our product would be more in line with World prices since we have about a product and the rest of the world reduce cost of production should result in an improved production opportunity for the u.s. producer I'm not here to debate whether the rest of the world should be smoking out Ibaka or any debacle but if people wish to consume a legal product we want it to be ours to buy a quota is an asset tied to our land I don't believe it's right to take it away without compensation	 if allotment holders could be compensated for quota that they own and produces provide a transition payments with production remaining in current growing areas with some sort of safety net we could move forward and again participate in a global debacle Market younger Farmers could plan for the future all the farmers could continue to raise tabaka or they could make plans for retirement	 right now the farming Community is almost in a state of panic wondering if another quote of code is cut is coming and how large will it be along with having a crop in the field in Virginia right now and that's probably will go down as one of the worst in recent history due to the excessive rainfall we've had my son has expressed a desire to return the Family Farm after college and be frank with you I don't know what to tell him we ventured into the poultry business as a way he could possibly return to the farm full-time but in Southside Virginia that	 the only way possible is that is to raise tobacco as well but this Southside Virginia relies heavily on agriculture but if we are reeling from the loss of jobs in our factories and our textile industry very few young people are finding employment in our area and Doug looking elsewhere for jobs I want my children to have the opportunity to stay in Southside if they desire I hope my son will be able to choose whether he wants to be a fourth generation tobacco farmer and not have outside sir	 from stances dictate for him his career choice I thank you for your time and your consideration may God bless each of you and your daily deliberations thank you	 thank you mr. Moore mr. Wilk Wiggles where welcome you as well	 thank you mr. chairman and other members of the House agriculture committee for holding this hearing today to discuss ways to make the active tobacco grower more competitive and more profitable I'm David Winkles president of the South Carolina Farm Bureau and I'm speaking today on behalf of the back of your Deuces Nationwide and the American Farm Bureau Federation it's important to note that foreign Bureau represents tobacco producers in 20 states with the largest quota acreage in North Carolina Kentucky Tennessee	 South Carolina Virginia Georgia and Ohio according to the 1997 US Census of Agriculture u.s. tobacco is produced on over eight hundred thirty thousand acres on ninety thousand Farms however tobacco production has declined by 46 percent over the last 50 years and tobacco acreage has declined by 73% the tobacco program has served Farmers for over 60 years the began as a program intended to control the production of tobacco and	 as the price while at the same time preventing any one company from monopolizing the market for the most part the program was successful in achieving these objectives however the last 10 years Market forces have changed and public opinion pressure has decreased domestic cigarette purchases over the past seven years Burley and flue-cured producers have lost half of their quota as a result producers of face with higher input cost and at the same time compelled to produce less tobacco	 even as prices for cigarettes rise the tobacco Farmers portion of the retails tobacco dollar has fallen from Seven cents in 1982 less than two cents today	 more than half of the tobacco Farms that existed 25 years ago are gone today while American agriculture is faced lean times over the past few years tobacco Farmers have also struggled with massive industry changes is the value of U s-- tobacco production declines it's imperative that we take into consideration the families that are economically and socially impacted by this loss of income the income and revenue generated provides critical assistance for education and Healthcare	 that would otherwise suffer tobacco quotas have real economic value for Farmers communities and governments there simply is not an equitable substitute or alternative means of income to transition to with the loss of tobacco production in so many of these rural economies an important component of a debacle buyout is to provide compensation to Tobacco Growers and quota owners recently tobacco Growers have been squeezed by big drops and demand for us tobacco	 ooh both here and abroad by aggressive competition from cheaper foreign grown tobacco the high cost of modernized equipment demanded by manufacturers and by Modest increases in price for their own crops the future of tobacco and the communities who have come to depend on the income generated from tobacco farming is very important to American Farm Bureau farmers and their families are desperate for a new direction for the de for the tobacco program it is imperative that we develop a program that provides	 orderly transition from the current price support system compensate Growers and quota owners for the equity that they built in the program and to do it at no net cost to the taxpayer Farm Bureau suggest that anybody out meet the following basic principles first and foremost provides back of quota holders with fair and Equitable compensation for their quotas tobacco quota owners should be compensated at $8 a pound	 quota is a government back asset that many people rely on friend come elimination of that quota warrants compensation and we also feel that we should provide tobacco Growers with transition payments at four dollars per pound of tobacco produced producers must receive fair compensation second the right to grow should be in the hands of active Growers now we'll remove non-essential cost	 thirdly just as the 2002 Farm Bill provided safety net for producers of other agricultural Commodities there needs to be an adequate safety net for producers American Farm Bureau supports HR 245 the tobacco Equity elimination Act of 2003 is a good starting point the crisis facing tobacco producers and their communities requires decisive action to address a complex array of problems and needs associated with reducing economic dependence on Tobacco	 and diversifying farming operations and local economies do the dire needs of tobacco quota holders farmers and communities I respectfully request the Committee reported tobacco by out Bill to the House of Representatives for consideration as soon as possible thank you for the opportunity to testify thank you mr. Winkles mr. right we're also pleased to have you with us from Virginia today	 thank you mr. chairman	 mr. chairman and members of the committee thank you for the opportunity to address you and to share with you some positions and concerns about it the back of my eye out	 I'm Don reiter birdie producer from Southwest Virginia where I serve as chairman of the Southwest Virginia agricultural Association I'm also a member of Virginia's working to back a group and Virginia Farm bureau's Burley tobacco committee	 first	 make no mistake	 we are in favor of a tobacco by out that includes eight dollars a pound for quote a holders for dollars a pound for producers based on a year that is most advantageous to the farmer	 this will allow non-producing quota holders to get out of the de Baca business with dignity	 at the same time it will allow allow producers of fair return on their investment and labor in an already tight market and will also bring some competition to the World Market second we realize that the tobacco program as we know it today will probably not continue	 the program is not completely broken	 but it's in a sad state of repair	 however we can ill afford to abandon the intent of the program and throw production open to anyone and everyone has so many are already advocating	 if this occurs a huge Surplus would soon be on our hands	 therefore we adamantly request that you incorporate into legislation a playing the control supply and demand based on company buying intentions this plan could be in the form of a license agreement with current producers who desire to continue producing tobacco further the license will be transferable only to an immediate family member who wishes to continue in the business and	 to the confines of the current tobacco producing regions	 third some type of safety net must be integrated into legislation as is already the case with other agricultural commodities	 this will help to defray the cost of production in the event of a natural disaster	 fourth if the buyout comes comes to fruition we can and will work with the FDA if the FDA regulates tobacco as a tobacco product and not as a drug	 yes we do want a safe product we strongly support current research efforts by several universities and private industries that work to reduce tobacco-specific nitrosamines levels	 p.f. Southwest Virginia has suffered a loss of 59% in basic quota since 1997 growing season until the present time	 this translates into a loss of approximately 30 million dollars annually of gross income in mainly six counties of Appalachia	 we're in Southwest Virginia or small in comparison to the rest of the country	 but based on this data you can imagine the impact in Lost dollars to our already economically depressed area	 for your information I have attached copies of both the core principles statement between the Public Health Community and the tabaka producers community and also the statement by the Virginia tobacco working group to the US House committee on agriculture subcommittee on specialty crops and agricultural programs	 we support both of these documents	 we do not want to be a part of the problem	 but rather a part of the solution	 we hope to be able to work together to protect our children's health and the family farm	 as well as to strengthen the economy of all tobacco producing regions of our country	 the future of the hard-working family farmers and our region of Virginia critically depends upon your decision	 thank you for your time and attention to this vastly important matter thank you mr. Jeremy thank you mr. Wright I want to take the opportunity to acknowledge the presence in the hearing room of
