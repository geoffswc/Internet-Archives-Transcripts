you have several more hearings and then beginning on March 12th mark up this bill so that we can get it to the floor of the Senate and move forward on this settlement, the proposed settlement is built around a central premise in exchange for receiving certain limitations of liability the industry would agree to make payments numbering in the hundreds of billions of dollars in concede to the imposition of various and limitations on the advertising marketing and sale of tobacco products, close the door back there in the garden crowd outside the lined up out the streets this morning, thank you very much Senator Ford thank you very much Senator fort, the revenue stream from industry payments would be available to fund health research counter advertising campaigns smoking cessation programs and provide compensation for losses due to the use of harmful tobacco products also underpinning the settlement is the stated desire of the major tobacco companies to take a new approach to their business practices this is the idea that the proposed settlement involves a change in the culture of the tobacco companies the nation welcome such a change in, the nation demands it the recent release of various internal tobacco documents makes it clear that historically tobacco companies have failed the Candor test despite the industry assurances in testimony to the contrary we know now that the tobacco companies have long known that nicotine is addictive the extent to which smoking is harmful to health that there are ways to enhance nicotine kick and cigarettes, and that marketing programs have been targeted at kids the tobacco companies simply must face the fact that because of your industry's history you have a significant credibility problem the American public in this committee deserve the truth inside this hearing room and now we expect it and we demand It Whatever the scope of tobacco legislation our primary goal is clear and unambiguous to dramatically reduce tobacco use by children, I'll consider potential tobacco legislation a failure if we're not confident it will achieve significant reductions in you smoking I also believe this committee and the American people are in agreement on this goal I look forward to a critical analysis of the many questions posed by tobacco legislation I thank the CEOs for coming to this hearing I look forward to your testimony into the discussion that follows I'd like to ask members if they have brief comments Senator fort, thank you mr. chairman I want to thank you personally for calling this hearing this morning there's been a lot of attention in the media about the tobacco settlement and what impact the settlement might have on the public health the federal Treasury and on Tobacco companies one aspect of the settlement though has been neglected its impact on Tobacco farmers and their communities, mr. chairman there's 60,000 tobacco farmers in my state of Kentucky alone and over 120,000 throughout the southeast they grow different types of tobacco in different states but they all depend on the same thing that the backup program administered by USDA, the tobacco program which keeps prices high and limits the supply of tobacco is paid for by the tobacco farmer and their customers many of whom are with us today a no net cost assessment is paid on each pound of tobacco to ensure that taxpayers never foot the bill for the price support program in addition to the no net cost assessment Farmers also pay a budget deficit assessment that contributes about 30 million dollars to, treasury each year this assessment isn't collected from any other producer just the tobacco farmer despite the fact that the program is paid for despite the fact that tobacco Farmers paid to reduce the deficit and despite the fact that the president and many and public health communities now support the program and that's right mr. chairman they support the program there are senators and others who want to take this program away from the farmers who pay for it and run it, mr. chairman I want to emphasize the support of the Public Health Community for the tobacco program major public health groups are working with tobacco Farmers to develop a set of core principles to govern the debate on Tobacco policy this includes groups like The National Center for tobacco-free kids and the American Public Health Association principle number one reads as follows and I quote the parties agree that it Tobacco production control program which, Supply and which sets a minimum price purchase price is in the best interest of the Public Health Community and the tobacco producing community and surgeongeneral Coop and former FDA commissioner David Kessler have gone on record supporting the continued operation of the tobacco program so long as it operates at no cost to the taxpayer now I'm going to be asking our Witnesses a little more about the program and what it means to States like Kentucky but the bottom line, line mr. chairman is this ending the tobacco program means throwing tens of thousands of farmers out of work it means the end of hundreds of rural communities throughout the southeast it means spending hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayers dollars and it means providing as much as a billion dollar windfall to the tobacco companies every year many senators including you mr. chairman have agreed with me that the tobacco farmer must be taken care of in any, adopted by the Congress even the president in his five principles has acknowledged finally that protections for the farmer and his community must be a key part of any legislation Mi ly ly fact is co-sponsored by Senators Hollings and frisked on this committee as well as six other tobacco state senators mr. chairman I'm grateful to you that you have Incorporated this Farm proposal in Your settlement bill that you introduced it does protect the, a farmer and his community and it does so by starting with the thing that keeps those communities thriving in the first place the program that ought to be the litmus test of any farmer proposal, since the June 20th agreement was announced we've seen a number of proposals to implement the settlement I think many of us on this committee would agree that these proposals are spinning out of control the latest proposal would raise tobacco taxes by a dollar and a half per pack and require the industry to pay fifteen billion dollars up front it includes penalties which include could add another dollar 74 packed and even this extreme proposal isn't, the end of the road I've taken the time to total up the various proposals that have been floated to spend monies collected by the settlement the settlement assume that payments in the first five years would be fifteen nine billion dollars the present budget assumes a higher figure sixty six billion when you add up all of the other proposals health research funding child care tax cuts Elementary class size reduction and many others the total of, of all the ideas and Congress so far on how to spend tobacco money exceeds 126 billion dollars in the first five years more than double the original settlement, we need a reality check mr. chairman I believe we're at the point where we're really talking about funny money dollars that will never be there to fund all these wonderful programs why because we may just drive the companies into bankruptcy by demanding too much too fast I didn't support the latest proposal to be offered in fact I along with three other Democratic colleagues wrote to the vice president urging him to begin bipartisan negotiations on a settlement, we can pass I renew that call today because as I said in our letter partisan proposal simply have no chance of becoming law on this point mr. chairman I want to compliment you yours is the only Bill out there that is bipartisan I appreciate that and I appreciate you're beginning a process today that I hope will lead to a strong bipartisan Bill a bipartisan bill will do what's necessary to fight teen smoking, we've lost the whole thrust the righteous indignation ending indignation in the beginning against tobacco has now turned into greed and it will do what's necessary to protect the tens of thousands of farmers who depend on debate on Tobacco so thank you mr. chairman for your leadership and I look forward to today's testimony thank you very much Senator Ford Center Burns, mr. chairman I would ask unanimous consent that my entire statement be made part of the record I will just have a couple of statements out of Jackson, back June 20th and 1997 when the settlement was reached between the tobacco companies and most of the state's attorney generals, that accomplished some goals most of us would not have believed that could have been reached in our lifetimes it was it would substantially raise the price of cigarettes and tobacco items have four and it would provide for programs which are designed to reduce teen smoking, so what and as we go through this and I want to congratulate the chairman like like Senator Ford has done today taking care of all the people that have far-reaching ramifications in this settlement in the curtailment of some of their their commercial Enterprises, all the way from the from the from the men and women on the on our land that that depend on this crop for a living in the communities that depend on it, to the people who process and to the people who distribute, all of them are small for the most part small business people, and they will be seriously impacted, and in this whole settlement and all this whole controversy, what are the companies asking for upon this settlement, well what they're asking for is knowing how much money they'll have to pay to achieve what we know the benefits of the settlement, the media has portrayed what tobacco companies want is immunity, and I personally don't believe in agreeing to pay 350 billion dollars, to settle a case is immunity, in any other in any other case law, if someone rear-ends a car and causes injury to the driver to the car and the settlement is reached for injuries property damage pain and suffering the amount of money isn't called immunity it's called a settlement and no one in this country has ever been awarded to 50 billion dollars in punitive damages by a jury ever the fact is tobacco companies are willing to pay that amount after never losing a jury trial in to think that is almost incredible but it isn't, Unity, no one likes to see young people smoke or even start to smoke, but to get to the point where we can do something about it we also have to watch what we do as far as the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States of America whether we like it or not everybody has the rights afforded under that document, so I congratulate the set the the chairman today for bringing this forward I am not an attorney never been hinged with that title don't want to be but I will say this that we have a First Amendment and if it and if it's disregarded here where will it be disregarded in later cases on down the line and I thank the chairman, thank you very much Senator Bernsen I would ask my colleagues for their indulgences to make their opening comments as brief as possible so we can get to the witnesses I know that this is an important time in the these hearings and everyone wants to be on record as their position I understand and appreciate that as well Senator White, thank you mr. chairman gentlemen four years ago your predecessors came to the US House of Representatives swore to tell the truth and in response to my questions stated that nicotine is not addictive, mr. Bible your predecessor told me that nicotine is not addictive mr. Goldstone your predecessor told me that nicotine is not addictive mr. Brooks your predecessor told me that nicotine is not addictive the same is true for mr. Tisch and mr. Guerra, gentlemen subsequent to that 1994 hearing documents were made public demonstrating that Executives at the highest levels of your company's new in fact that nicotine is addictive, now in your prepared testimony for today you asked the United States Senate to approve a settlement by which your company shall pay the American people three hundred and sixty eight point five billion dollars for all the health problems they have suffered or will continue to suffer because of your products, you urge the Congress to Grant unprecedented legal protection for your industry as part of the settlement, I want to be blunt it is the tobacco industry's track record on truth-telling that makes your eagerness for this settlement so suspect the testimony of your predecessors built a high wall of skepticism that you are going to have to work hard to cross over skepticism about addiction about the international marketing of cigarettes to children and, about the targeting of youngsters in minority neighborhoods, and I want to wrap up with one last point, I want to protect youngsters in this country in Bend Oregon for example in Boston where Senator Kerry I'll lives but I want to make sure that we also protect youngsters in Bangkok and Bangladesh I'm going to do my best to make sure that morality doesn't stop at Oregon's beautiful Coastline finally mr. chairman you and I have discussed many of these issues privately I'm grateful, you're independent and objective analysis of the challenge that tobacco legislation presents to the Commerce Committee and I look forward to working with you and our colleagues to get a good bipartisan Bill to the senate floor thank you very much Senator Wyden Senator Stevens, I have no Senator Kerry mr. Sherman thank you very much first of all for having this hearing and for your leadership and the past months on this issue, I'm very sensitive to what Senator Burns and, Senator Ford if said and I'm glad that we arrived here finally at a time where the proposals that are on the table I acknowledge the concerns of Senator Ford in the need to be sensitive to the needs of farmers and those who might be affected and there is some truth in what Senator burns are said about the nature of the judicial system and punitive damages, the difficulty here and I want this and I think my colleagues share this feeling that this should be a dialogue and not a bashing session though there's a lot of anger the both in the American people and I think on this side of the dais about the track record and Candor requires that we at least say that that that that anger exists it's not going to do us any good any of us to look at this settlement offer, and simply continue a process of being angry we need to find a solution for the American people and we need to recognize that you've come here with a certain recognition I would say of the road that has been traveled it's a whole new group of Executives that are in front of us today you are not the people who answered the questions to Senator Wyden but nevertheless we ask you to, and the full measure of our sense, of trepidation at entering into agreement that somehow sets out a fixed sum of money for damages currently understood when we are still learning about the full measure of some of your company's efforts to Market some of those who will who have yet to to fall ill or to to suffer the consequences of the choices that they've made the statistics are absolutely staggering, in a sense there's a contradiction that I think all of us feel as we sit here trying to Grapple with the notion you know how much money do we provide to make up for the fact that more people are going to die in one year as a consequence of the product you sell then died in all of World War Two, you know we had 10 years of bitter debate and fighting in our country over the longest war in American history which took 58,000 Young American lives but the product you sell openly on the market and Market up until this time to kids, kill seven or eight times that every single year we know it we know what it costs our hospitals and our Health Care system and yet that product is going to continue to be sold so the measure of responsibility that is demanded here I think you would agree with me is significant and I think most of what is recognized in the settlement tries to acknowledge that but there's a very significant question still open about this issue of liability, I mean I have to measure the question of liability against the statistics I'll be very quick mr. chairman you know 89 percent of smokers I understand it maybe you can contradict this but 89 percent of smokers began when they were young, and most smokers begin at the age of 13 and a half or so and they're they're Smokin regularly by time they're 14, 90-plus percent of those young people this country recognize Joe Camel more people than recognize Ronald McDonald, that's a tribute to your advertising capacity but we also know that the three top cigarette brands I think it's Marlboro Newport and camel, our Smoked by kids while by 86 percent of kids but only 35% of adults smoke those friends John so the power of your advertising is extraordinary and my hope is that what we're going to resolve here in the course of the next days, is this issue of liability is there some middle ground or is there a way to appropriately reflect what may yet come down the pike that we can't predict that that maintains the capacity for a settlement that doesn't do Injustice if that's an inappropriate word to you but at the same time balances our needs to recognize what the future damage may be and what we may learn in the future even more about the connection between, smoking and future costs to the country and that's the great issue before us, thank you Senator Kerry Senator Brian, thank you very much mr. chairman let me add my Commendation to you for holding this hearing as well as the others that are focused on this issue the panel before us today speaks volumes of just how different the world of tobacco is today in 1994 when each of your predecessors testified before the house is my colleague has mentioned each of them swore that tobacco was not addictive I doubt that any of you will take that position today, and more than the names and faces of change since 1994 the nation's own view about tobacco and smoking products has been significantly altered as a former State Attorney General I know how difficult it was for the 40 State Attorneys General to come together and try to negotiate a legitimate settlement with the tobacco companies to resolve their state lawsuits I also know that you would not have come to the table without some direct benefits most significantly a limitation of liability, since the June 1997 signing of the negotiated tobacco settlement Tobacco Company documents have been released that indicate that there was a concerted and a premeditated decision by tobacco companies to Target underage children to entice them to smoke as a lawmaker I'm offended as a parent I'm outraged and so these hearings today are in the context of the that history and I don't think any of us, beer can forget it every day there are 3,000 young people who begin smoking roughly a third of them will die prematurely due to smoking related illnesses this Congress is had responsibility to deal with this issue and there is a public policy issue that involves enormous cost to federal and state governments in terms of the health related cost incurred as a result of smoking I regret to say that my state has the highest rate of prevalence of any state in the country when it comes to, smoking but 198 million dollars a year is the price tag of of smoking-related illnesses in our own State approximately 11:00 nevadans will die of lung cancer this year some mr. chairman I look forward to working with you and other members of this committee and fashioning a settlement the deals effectively with the issue of underage smoking I believe it's smoking is an adult choice in the thrust of our efforts should be too focused on the young people and to prevent, them from living a life of poor health and ultimately death as result of consuming this dangerous product mr. chairman I would ask that the balance of my statement be made a part of the record without objection cheddar Gordon, mr. chairman we're here kid then obviously very interesting time to hear from these gentlemen I am interested in what they will have to say that differs from what various congressional committees have heard previously but I am also as a member from a state that is a leader in the tobacco litigation, and interested in their comments and in their ability to prove those comments as to how deep the well actually is I hope one or more of these gentlemen will tell us at what point a set of liabilities imposed on them will simply cause them to file at least in chapter 11 in bankruptcy and what the impact on all of, of these proposed settlements and changes would be under those circumstances perhaps each of them will tell us so what the net worth of is that company is because that has something to do with it I am somewhat concerned about the way in which everyone wants a share of money that we probably wouldn't be getting had it not been for the state of, he's General the president that wants 60 billion dollars but has given us nothing but a few feel good stead statements about what kind of settlement he actually proposes the states of course want there's Farmers that kind of want to cut because fewer people will be using a tobacco vending machines of want to bail out because they'll be out of business Labour wants its share, are they and everyone else is involved in it personally I believe that anything we get ought to go to the directly to those who have paid costs as a result of tobacco which means to a considerable extent the our Medicare trust funds and other similar activities but I do hope that these gentlemen will tell us you know at what point the whole matter simply gets upset, we have filings in bankruptcy we have a net worth that can go into a settlement but how much less is that going to be if it is less than what they've already offered, thank you Senator dorgan but German, yes sir I have to go to a hearing but I've been asked to submit two questions mr. Bible I want to find that objection Senator dark I was in a little general store in a small town recently and Page through some boxes they had of old magazines they had saved and I was thinking I saw the cigarette ads and 50 and 60 year old magazines the most famous people in the country, actors news men and women and others were advertising cigarettes and the advertisement actually said smoke cigarettes to improve your health smoking cigarettes is the road to Good Health smoking cigarettes promotes a good lifestyle well we now know 50 60 years later that's not true at all that tobacco use injures one Health one is Health it is addictive it can cause cancer heart disease and more and so we're making progress in this area a one step at a time this hearing is, one more important step mr. chairman I appreciate your calling the hearing I will include other statements in a statement for the record and I appreciate the witnesses coming to the committee today thank you very much Senator dorgan Center bro and I thank you mr. chairman for having hearing very briefly I think that you know the old saying what a difference a day makes I mean I think Senator dorgan pointed it out as have others what a difference but generation makes I mean who would have thought, that five years ago even that we would be looking at an agreement that we're trying to see whether it should be implemented or not that number one regulates nicotine as a drug by the Food and Drug Administration for allow FDA to regulate tobacco products as a nicotine delivering device would provide funding for many Tobacco Control initiatives that have been long sought by public health initiatives that, industry would no longer be able to gear its advertising towards children and that penalties would be imposed upon companies if indeed they did not reduce the use of their products in the area of children we have come a long way after 40 Years of litigation I don't think a single claim has ever been paid out, I'm not sure that will change in if we don't enact some type of a settlement I'm not sure if any of these things were going to be possible or if anyone's going to ever be compensated if we continue down the same path that we have for the last 40 50 years so I think Congress has a unique opportunity we have to be fair we have to be insistent that it be followed very carefully that it get the job done that there are no holes that can be punched in this agreement one of the interesting aspects I mean if all of these programs, to be paid for by a user fee on De backer if we were successful in getting everyone to quit smoking whereas the user fee going to come from I mean these are all questions that I think need to be considered the hearing will do that and I'm glad that you're holding it thank you thank you Senator bro we'd like to begin with opening statements now we'll begin with our Witnesses are mr. Jeffrey Bible is the chairman and CEO of Philip Morris companies mr. Steven Gold Stone is the chairman and CEO of RJR Nabisco, mr. Vinson gear who's the chairman and CEO of UST Incorporated mr. Nicholas Brooks the chairman CEO Brown & Williamson tobacco Corporation in mr. Lawrence tissues the co-chairman of the board and co-ceo of Lowe's Corporation we'd like to begin with you mr. Bible, well thank you mr. chairman mr. chairman and members of the committee good morning, I think perhaps I should draw this closer, I'm Jeff Bible for the past three years I've been chairman and chief executive officer of Philip Morris companies I'm proud to represent the largest consumer Products Company in the world and even prouder of our more than 150,000 employees including 70,000 here in the United States who develop manufacture and Market many of the world's leading brands in the tobacco food and beer Industries, mr. chairman I'm here to listen as well as to speak I want to assure each member of this committee that I know how important it is to engage in a two-way discussion, I recognize that the tobacco industry is the subject of intense criticism for its past actions and for its role in the social political and legal controversy over tobacco products, and I believe that many of the authors of this criticism are responsible people with legitimate concerns, we are here today after 40 Years of increasingly angry litigation and conflict in many instances we operated as if we felt under a virtual state of Siege which too often has resulted in our failure to compromise cooperate or Embrace changes sought by our critics, our failure has in turn led to even greater confrontation without resolving any of the controversial issues in hindsight I wish that years ago I'd had the foresight to try and find common ground with our critics although no one can change the past I've tried to draw lessons from it so since becoming chairman and CEO I have searched for a better way to address and resolve the issues about our product and our industry, when I became chairman I realized that I faced a critical personal choice, I believe that if I look backward I would be forced to spend every bit of my time looking into literally hundreds of issues and allegations and thousands of documents and I concluded that Looking Backward would only drive myself and my company deeper and deeper into a pointless position of conflict and fighting, or I could take my energies and whatever abilities I have and look forward I wanted to try to find a way to cut this gordian knot of conflict and anger and help shape a future in which we could live as what we know we are good and responsible corporate citizens in a society that recognizes that more than 40 million adult Americans choose to smoke and that tobacco is a risky product which should be restricted to adults, mr. chairman I believe that too broad but starkly different paths towards the future lie before us which future would be better either ceased this courtroom Regulatory and legislative battles and an expanding mass of civil litigation that could end only in more acrimony or a reasonable and fair conclusion this year too much of the conflict a pragmatic conclusion that yields real progress on issues of, concern to society, I believe that the proposed resolution represents the better path it reflects Common Ground shared by our industry and many of its leading critics today I would like to highlight two issues that I believe deserves special attention, because the Civil liability provisions of the proposed resolution have drawn so much attention let me address them first as you know the resolution provides for a comprehensive program which regulates the manufacture marketing and advertising of tobacco products it includes the voluntary abandonment of most of our first amendment advertising rights it requires billions of dollars from the industry to fund programs that Congress deemed necessary, sorry to implement its policy decisions and it provides for the reimbursement of health care costs and provides funds for compensation for injured smokers, however it makes no sense to adopt such a program while still maintaining a tort system that could undermine the entire plan destruction of the financial viability of these tobacco companies benefit no one and will do absolutely nothing to advance a legitimate Public Health agenda, the Civil liability provisions of the proposed resolution are designed to preserve individuals rights to claim compensation while avoiding a circumstance in which a small number of huge judgments can leave little if anything for the vast majority of individuals or States these provision should be evaluated on their own merits by two criteria, first whether they are reasonable under all the circumstances of a comprehensive new plan for tobacco and second how they compared to the alternative of the present system I submit that the Civil liability Provisions are clearly reasonable and are far superior to the present system from an overall public policy standpoint, they are reasonable because nothing in the proposed resolution allows the companies to escape accountability for any improper past actions or future conduct, contrary to what has become a popular misconception the industry will not be obtaining immunity individuals can still super competent Tory damages including pain and suffering without any limitations on a mount and while punitive damage claims for past conduct will be settled through industry payments of more than 60 billion dollars the industry is fully liable for punitive damages for anything it may do wrong in the future, although there will be an annual cap on the amount the industry is required to pay in any year the annual cap is in the billions of dollars and will not reduce the amount of any plaintiffs claim it ensures that the industry must pay all judgements against it and that companies do not Escape their liability by resorting to bankruptcy, furthermore eliminating class actions against the industry will prevent large judgments from swapping the industry benefiting some claimants at the expense of most and at the expense of the programs which are to be funded by the continuing stream of payments contemplated by the proposed resolution, the Civil liability Provisions are far superior to the present system from an overall public policy standpoint when judged against the very real Alternatives that exist without them, on the one hand the industry may continue its track record of courtroom successes and no one or very few will collect anything on the other hand it may be swamped with judgments in favor of States class action platers or individual plaintiffs in which case claimants both governmental and private will be paid only a small fraction of their claims it is plain that the provisions of the proposed resolution are better for everyone then, any of the Alternatives because they are reasonable and better than the Alternatives they should be enacted next I'd like to turn to the issue of international marketing practices I am concerned as you are with some aspects of international tobacco marketing which may not have been as sensitive to youth smoking as they should have been, we are working to address this problem at Philip Morris we have initiated 60 programs against youth smoking in 36 countries and we are increasing the momentum we launched 80 new programs last year and 35 more programs will launch this year, however there is a significant limit to what we can do unilaterally Market realities elsewhere are vastly different than in the US, outside the nited States our competitors have 87 percent of the market to our 13% and included among those competitors are many powerful foreign Nations such as China and Japan more than half of all cigarettes sold outside the United States are manufactured by companies owned by Foreign governments	 I know that some in Congress believe the details of this proposed resolution should be translated to every corner of the world but I don't believe that we can be effective agents of change in foreign markets by taking unilateral marketing steps which would only make us less and less in for influential players in those markets nevertheless Philip Morris is committed to doing whatever we can internationally to address the issue of Youth smoking	 and let me tell you how	 Philip Morris is committed to pursue five essential initiatives on youth smoking first we will work to support minimum wage laws in every country s we will work to support youth access programs everywhere third we all support youth anti-smoking programs organized in concert with education and health officials in every country excuse me	 fourth we will put an underage use prohibited or adult use only label on every package in every Market where it is legally possible to do so finally we will work with governments and our competitors proactively to try to change the marketing practices of this industry worldwide to achieve the reforms necessary to reduce youth smoking in each country in which we operate	 obviously as I have said this cannot be done unilaterally we have to change the competitive rules and keep the playing field level so that all our competitors are bound as we are but we will undertake that challenge I believe in accountability our Executives weight will make these initiatives and integral part of their business plans and report on their progress to me	 in conclusion mr. chairman I believe that our nation is at an important Crossroads with respect to the future of public policy on Tobacco issues if my perception is corrected most people believe that adults who wish to smoke should continue to be able to do so legally and that these companies should be able to continue in business and the question is how should the industry conduct itself and be regulated going forward	 the proposed resolution is intended to address that question in a comprehensive and sensible way and I would urge its enactment thank you mr. chairman	 thank you mr. Goldstone you mr. chairman good morning I appreciate the opportunity to be here so we can talk about ending the fighting I was a mic not I'm sorry	 they get that when they are like that	 that's better so we can talk about ending the fighting ending the constant conflict of the past four decades	 I'd like to talk about charting a new direction direction which my company can be in a position not a fighting but of cooperating with government and cooperating with the public health community	 over the past three years since I became our Jr.'s chief executive I have grappled just like apparently mr. Bible has at Philip Morris with how to find a process that could bring about constructive change in a rational and civil manner	 and Senator Wyden when I was listening to your remarks thinking about a change and a process that doesn't require that we approach the subject without skepticism given the past it's really a process that is not based on whether you believe everything Steve Goldstone says or everything that my colleagues say although I hope you would	 but rather establishes the necessary regulation and enforcement so that for years to come tobacco companies can compete for adult customers in a responsible and a socially acceptable way	 I have to tell you I think it's a tough task the intensity and the level of hostility is really pretty amazing from my point of view as a relatively new chief executive now but I do think we are compelled to step above the war in the courts and in the newspapers and in Congress and jointly try to provide the leadership and the common sense that's necessary to resolve the problems every one of us agrees we have to	 with dress now a month ago we all testified before the house Commerce Committee and I talked about my fundamental belief that I think many Americans share that tobacco companies ought to be able to sell their products to adult consumers so long as these companies recognize that these products have health risks and that they must cooperate with the public health authorities and I talked about documents from	 the early 1970s that and the 1970s that Congress whack a congressman Waxman released from my tobacco company and I talked about the fact that I had real problems with these documents as chairman of RJR Nabisco and as a father they represent a way of doing business that I simply don't agree with	 it's just unacceptable today to look at the habits of adolescence in determining how to make business plans in a tobacco company	 I said then and I say today it is immoral it is unethical and it is illegal obviously to sell to minors I am convinced about those ethics in those morals today and I know that Andy Schindler and the people who run our domestic tobacco business and our International tobacco business agree with my point of view completely if they didn't they wouldn't be running those companies	 at those hearings we covered a number of other difficult issues many of which I'm sure will cover today but at the end of the hearing I did think there was a good faith desire among the people at that hearing to bring people to the table not to exclude them and I really did see a serious intent to address how we can collectively resolve the problem of you smoking and the manufacturing and the marketing and the litigation issues	 there's been a lot written and said about the agreement we had negotiated with the attorneys General and others and I wanted to tell you so you'd have at least my perspective of why I saw a need to have those discussions and ultimately agreed to the provisions I don't run a company as large as Phillip Mars but it is the sixth largest consumer product company in the world we have a lot of terrific Brands among them Winston and	 animal which are Brands we make talk about a little today but we also have Chips Ahoy and Oreos and Planter's Peanuts and Lifesavers	 It's a Wonderful company but I cannot plan for the long-term when one of my companies is viewed as being outside the mainstream of Commerce it's where it's absorbed in massive litigation and has virtually every marketing campaign it engages in scrutinized to the nth degree and where it has no normal working relationship with federal and state governments	 as which the Bible said 40 Years of litigation hasn't done a heck of a lot of good for our industry when I came here and in the two years I've been chief executive we have 13 very big jury trials and while when those verdicts were announced there was quite a lot of her eye and cheers within the company frankly I don't know what good that has done this industry or our company	 on the other side with although I think some very good press and some good speeches and a lot of litigation brought I don't see the other side the public health side gaining tremendously either in the last 40 years but fortunately a year ago we sat down at the table with the attorneys General some representatives of the Public Health Community and others who we had been fighting with intensely and for three months that group put aside politics put a	 I'd all the scientific definitions and all the other issues we had fought over in court and in the pressed and many times even here in Congress there was leadership and there was Common Sense around the table and the result was an extraordinary comprehensive agreement that I don't think was thinkable just a year ago I'm proud of that effort but I have to tell you that proposed agreement has not had the benefit of much leadership since it was signed and I	 think it's been unfairly criticized and it seems fairly obvious to me that the political unpopularity of tobacco today has made it very easy for some people to say this agreement is too soft on Tobacco and I want to spend just a minute to talk to you about that as it affects my company Reynolds our tobacco company in Winston-Salem its market share has been declining for 20 years in 1993 our earnings out of that	 mastic tobacco business were 2.4 billion dollars today those earnings are 1.4 billion dollars down a billion dollars in just those few years and on top of that as the consequence of the lbo for RJR Nabisco which I'm sure you're all familiar in the late 1980s RJR Nabisco the parent company is a financially weak company with a balance sheet burdened by debt our debt	 ratings are barely investment grade and are under - credit watch by the credit rating agencies this proposed resolution is going to add billions to our future obligations and will have no choice but to raise prices significantly which will reduce our volume our sales and our earnings even further so let me tell you regardless of what you read in the paper I can just tell you these Financial Obligations are anything but soft and our company and the only way	 that we are going to come close to a standing these obligations the burdens of meeting these obligations is through the Civil liability provisions and as mr. Bible said it is not immunity we're settling lawsuits with the state we're settling class action claims even though we've never lost any one of them there will be a judgment fund of five billion annually for future for future individual litigants plus a document depository that will make all the tobacco	 papers available for every person who wants to sue these tobacco companies that's not immunity its predictability	 and That's essential to our financial stability	 you know the Attorneys General recognize that without some reasonable limitations on these lawsuits that could threaten that very Financial stability these tobacco companies can hardly be expected to make the extraordinary marketing and financial concessions that form the heart of the agreement now I agreed to this settlement even though it included many many elements that our tobacco company in Winston-Salem has opposed for	 the years and which frankly are very critical to any consumer product company it's the essence of a consumer product company the ability to communicate with your customer	 that is what these companies are giving up in this proposed resolution but I did it because his stablishing the rules cooperating with government and having some form of litigation predictable exposure made sense for RJR Nabisco and are 80	000 employees and it makes sense for this country to because we have the chance after 40 Years of fruitless war in the courts war in the press and War in the Congress to	 it behind us and move into a new era of cooperation and comprehensive regulation and the proposed regulation regulation accomplishes these goals and I really respectfully ask the committee to step back to look at its elements in a fair manner step above the day-to-day Fray as you have on so many issues before we can have honest disagreements over past acts over elements of the proposals but we cannot lose opportunity lose sight of the	 unity before us and with your leadership I really think we can make a difference thank you mr. chairman thank you mr. Goldstone mr. gear	 good morning mr. chairman and members of the committee	 I am Vincent Garrett Chief Executive Officer of UST I welcome this opportunity to address the committee concerning the June 20th proposed resolution speaking on behalf of UST shareholders employees suppliers Growers and consumers I believe that the resolution if enacted into law by Congress will resolve many aspects of the controversy that has long surrounded tobacco products in this country I also firmly believe that addressing the controversy in a piecemeal fashion	 action without addressing all the components embodied in the proposed resolution may not achieve either the shared goal of reducing youth usage nor of other public policy objectives you Estes principal subsidiary United States tobacco company is a signatory to the resolution our company does not manufacture no Market cigarettes we do manufacture and Market smokeless tobacco products principally moist enough under the brand names of Copenhagen and skull of the	 the market for tobacco products smokeless tobacco comprises a small segment in 1997 smokeless tobacco constitute approximately four point seven percent of the tobacco market tobacco is one of the most controversial issues of our time	 historically no other product has been the subject of so much political activity popular concern and debate	 we believe that the country is at a Crossroads with regard to the tobacco issue the controversy that I surrounded tobacco products over the preceding decades has provided no positive outcome for anyone	 it's time to put the controversy beside us under the resolution at the backhoe industry has agreed to totally reform and restructure how tobacco products are manufactured marketed and distributed in the United States to achieve certain public policy objectives and to begin a new chapter for the industry from a social political and Regulatory perspective since June 20th and number of legislative proposals have been introduced some of which me	 provisions of the resolution and others which reflect more extreme views on how to address the current controversy with regard to smokeless tobacco products specifically I respectfully submit that to significant points should not be overlooked in the course of your deliberations first any tax was special assessment for smokeless tobacco products should take into account that government data recently highlighted by Secretary of Health and Human Resources Services Donna Shalala	 Lala indicated that youth usage is low and decreasing I would like to put up a chart reflecting this trend	 as you can see the chart shows that youth usage is already below the federal government's goal of four percent for the year 2000 second the average retail price of our company's products already fall well within the three dollar and fifty cent price range advocated by the president and public health experts as a means to achieve reductions in youth usage of tobacco products	 I believe that any proposal which fails to take into account these facts will result in an unfree a penalty to those adults who choose to use our products	 any comprehensive solution like the resolution is inherently a compromise reached after months of negotiations were all parties made concessions the resolution as a whole will impose many difficult demands on our company as well as the entire tobacco industry despite the substantial Burns and constraints to resolution would impose we are prepared to accept them in the interest of a national solution we believe that the resolution represents a fair balance of competing views	 rounding tobacco products we therefore recommend to the committee the resolution as a vehicle for a national comprehensive solution of this controversial issue we realized that it is only a is only a proposal even though in a stark one now it is up to Congress to exercise its legislative prerogatives as to the ultimate merits of the resolution thank you	 thank you very much mr. Brooks mr. chairman members of the committee I appreciate the opportunity to appear before the committee today in particular I welcome the opportunity to engage in a dialogue concerning the many issues surrounding tobacco use and particularly the problem of Youth smoking I wish we'd engaged in this debate many years ago is easy to criticize the past but with 20/20 hindsight it is clear that at some point in the debacle industry history	 we took the wrong path we concentrated on fighting off a tax instead of engaging in a dialogue on these difficult issues with government the result was too many years of conflict and confrontation as you know we believe that the best way to end this unfortunate history and to usher in a new era of Industry cooperation with government is to enact the proposed resolution	 to my knowledge our critics have not identified a single youth smoking initiative that is not already included in the proposed resolution the reason is clear the proposed resolution contains virtually everything on the Public Health Community wish list a long list of concessions that even our fiercest critics admit would have been unimaginable only months ago Chief among these and her are an array of advertising and marketing restrictions that would be unconstitutional apps in the industries agreement including a ban on human and cartoon images	 vending machine sales and billboards and other Outdoor Advertising the truth is the most attacks on the proposed resolution really have little to do with smoking instead they are attacked on the tobacco industry or they are attempts to extract more money from us let me say just a few words in response to these attacks and a few words about money	 first the attacks on our industry really are not new nor the industry documents that have generated recent headlines those documents and others like them have been known to our opponents for several years now the Attorneys General and the plaintiff lawyers who negotiated the proposed resolution insisted on massive payments and unprecedented restrictions because they assume the worst about us and they have said publicly but more or different documents would not have changed their negotiating position	 and now the issue of money the proposed resolution already places huge burdens on the tobacco industry the payments we have agreed to are quite literally staggering the financial burden will be compounded by unprecedented restrictions on our ability to Market our products and we cannot afford those burdens without some certainty as to our future litigation exposure and we are seeking certainty not immunity lawsuits will continue proposed resolution provides for payments of billions of	 dollars in settlements and judgments but there is a serious question whether we can continue to exist and to pay billions of dollars to the government if we're open to unlimited litigation exposure the proposed resolution provides a way to obtain billions of dollars from the industry for health programs Etc while quite frankly keeping the industry afloat to make those payments a sizable increase in the federal excise tax on the other hand which have exactly the opposite effect Senator Conrad's recent bill for example could easily drive the industry	 at a business this is documented in Greater detail in the report by dr. Robert Crandall senior fellow economic study of the Brookings institution which is being submitted for the record dr. Crandall's work shows that the $1.50 tax increase in the Conrad bull would reduce cigarette sales by more than 60% and virtually eliminate industry profits by 2002 in doctor Crandall's opinion adding the 15 billion non-deductible upfront payment in the Conrad bill	 what force most tobacco firms into insolvency even before 2002	 this 700% increase in the federal excise tax in only three years from today's 24 cents per pack to a dollar eighty nine per pack is not a youth smoking initiative at Act of this magnitude is a hugely regressive penalty on the approximately 45 million adult Americans who choose to smoke dollar fifty per pack in additional taxes amounts to a fifty dollar per month tax increase on a pack a day smoker	 make no mistake harshest critics do not want a Cooperative relationship they want to put us out of business but this would realistically serve no purpose other than despite the demise of the tobacco industry would eliminate some 1.8 million jobs from the seed beds of Kentucky to the mom and pop store in Downtown LA more than 50 billion per year in wages and other compensation would be lost at the economy and it would take away tax revenues of more than 35 billion per year and it would render worthless billions of dollars that	 of Americans who've invested either directly or through mutual funds and pension plans in stock of companies manufacturing and selling illegal product	 but taxing us out of business would not eliminate smoking the black market would take our place keep in mind that none of the regulations in the proposed resolution would apply to those black market cigarettes their sellers would not be licensed and it is unlikely that these sellers would care to verify the age of purchases or pay excise or other taxes frankly this is no way in my opinion to stop you smoking	 the sale of tobacco raises difficult issues and presents hard choices you can do nothing or take half measures and let confrontation and litigation continue or you can take a more challenging course I'm immensely encouraged that you mr. chairman have grasped the moment by introducing a comprehensive yet balanced Bill reflecting your perspective of the June 20th agreement we at Brown & Williamson believe that your bill does provide the opening for all sides who genuinely wish to see youth smoking reduced to work together on this	 complex issues in the spirit of true bipartisan cooperation I and my staff stand ready to provide whatever assistance we can in this process thank you very much thank you very much mr. Tisch	 good morning mr. chairman and members of the committee my name is Lawrence Tesh I am co-chairman and co-chief executive officer blows cooperation excuse me I'm very pleased to have the opportunity to appear before the committee today on the subject of the proposed National tobacco settlement in addition to my positions with Lowe's Corporation from 1986 to 1995 I was chairman and chief executive officer of CBS and I also	 presently is Chairman of the Board of Trustees of New York University	 lows Corporation is a diversified holding company with ownership interest in a number of major American companies including the sea and a family of insurance companies bull of a corporation Diamond offshore drilling Corporation and Loews hotels another of those subsidiaries subsidiary corporations in directly owned by Lowe's Corporation is lorillard tobacco company warlord which is headquartered in	 Greensboro North Carolina produces several brands of cigarettes Laurel odds current market share is approximately eight and three quarter percent of the United States cigarette Market Laura lot has no international business lorillard which was founded in 1765 operate operates under its own separate management and my personal involvement with his business has been very limited	 the less I will do my best to answer questions of this committee even though there may be some areas where I cannot be all that helpful with respect to the proposed resolution I am convinced mr. chairman that it is time to put confrontation behind us if cigarette use is going to remain legal in this nation for adults who choose to smoke we must rationalize how we are going to handle this product we must decide	 the terms and conditions upon which the product May continued to be sold	 my view is that there are three basic elements to any sound plan one increased regulation of the sale and promotion of cigarettes designed in particular particular to stop kids from smoking to the payment of money toward the perceived social or medical course of smoking	 three a rational litigation plan that preserves the right of individuals to sue where they believe that the tobacco industry's conduct has caused them harm but that gives the industry and by extension the farmers Distributors retailers and investors associated with the industry some measure of predictability	 mr. chairman as I have said I am not a tobacco executive and I was not involved in every aspect of the negotiations between the tobacco companies and the State Attorneys General and Public Health Community Representatives however due to the unprecedented and truly revolutionary nature of the proposed tobacco settlement and because Lowe's Corporation itself has been a party in a number of pending to be	 go litigations I did personally play a role in trying to come up with common sense solutions to certain of the issues that arose during these negotiations	 I can tell you that the other sides to the backhoe talks struck a very hard bargain with the tobacco companies putting aside the regulatory Provisions here which go beyond what the FDA has adopted and Beyond what constitutionally could be imposed upon the companies the companies have agreed to pay hundreds of billions of dollars in perpetuity three hundred and sixty eight point five billion in the first 10	 would be five years alone to be used to fund a wide array of Youth smoking prevention efforts and public health initiatives and when I say 368 and a half billion dollars putting aside the potentiality of the volume reductions that the Public Health Community very much hopes to accomplish by the proposed resolution that 368 billion is before the	 ation Factor written into this agreement and before the additional billions of dollars that be required to be paid under the look-back provision the escalation Factor now this is a factor of a minimum of three percent per year compounded means that at a minimum that 368 billion will actually equal five hundred and forty billion dollars over the first 20	 95 years of the proposed resolution and these ongoing payments then continue and automatically escalate in perpetuity	 in return for this financial commitment one never before sought or obtained from the manufacturer of any other consumer product the companies are not and I repeat the word not getting immunity from Individual tort claims for compensation by smokers and the Department of Justice representative David Ogden in his recent testimony before the house Judiciary Committee	 nice that reality all the tobacco companies are getting in the Civil liability area is a settlement of the State Attorneys General actions resolution of claims for punitive damages for past but not for future conduct and relief from mass aggregations of claims whether by smokers or third parties that by the sheer magnitude of expense and risk of dollars involved	 evolved make it difficult if not impossible for the companies to have a fair day in court and the company's bar providing money towards smoking cessation programs are getting relief from claims for damages based exclusively upon addiction	 I believe that the proposed resolution supported by all sides to last year's tobacco talks constitutes a realistic plan to rationalize how are they how our nation deals with cigarette smoking and other types of tobacco use a plan that permits us to move away from Decades of Confrontation and acrimony into a new area New Era of sensible regulation and Industry accountable	 bility I am sure that this plan is not perfect but it does represent a good faith and I believe very successful attempt by persons on all sides of this issue to arrive at a workable resolution of a difficult social problem	 but what I can tell you will not work of various unrealistic one-sided proposals that would result only in insolvency for the tobacco companies loss of Revenue to the federal and state governments and the handing over of the American Market to foreign companies and black market is I hope that this Congress will not let this us historic	 eternity past and will take the steps necessary to make this Accord possible thank you mr. chairman thank you very much mr. Tisch	 we'll have five minutes of questioning and further rounds if if necessary	 before we do dr. Frist would you care to make any opening coming	 we rely a great deal on dr. Frist in this committee he's the only one with any experience	 in many aspects of this issue and we appreciate his involvement for all of the witnesses	 before Congress last month I believe you conceded that nicotine is in fact addictive however industry spokesman Walter merryman who has been called the voice of tobacco when asked about whether the CEOs testified that nicotine is addictive answered quote I don't believe they testified that nicotine is addictive no sir	 so I guess I'm required to ask you that question again to clarify the record and on this issue and if it's agreeable to you we'll just start at either end I guess we'll begin with you mr. Brooks and go down that way and then start the opposite way in the next question for Miss Brooks thank you mr. chairman yes I think before the house Commerce Committee I did Express The View that many people in this country do believe that smoking is addictive and that by some definitions indeed by the 1988 sir	 General's definition the smoking would be regarded as addictive I personally took the view in the in the short time I was allowed to speak on the subject before that committee to point out that in I wouldn't personally in a serious debate about smoking label tobacco is addictive simply because I believe that the word Addiction in my use of that word means that people can't quit and is evident today that there is many Americans in the in the states who have smoked and quit as continue to	 smoke and therefore I don't think it's an appropriate word to use but I fully accept that other people use it and I have also clearly signed up to the resolution which requires that my company placed that warning on cigarette packs that you personally don't believe that it's addictive I personally wouldn't use that word in relation to smoking I think if you like me to explain a little further I do believe it's a reasonable point of view I hold but in 1964 the Surgeon General made a clear distinction between the hard drug use like crack cocaine and heroin	 and stimulants like tobacco and nicotine in tobacco and caffeine I just what I don't understand here cocaine is you can quit the hard drugs to I mean so if your if your definition of the of addictive is something that you can't quit then I guess that there's nothing then you under your definition than cocaine would not be addictive well no I don't believe that would be the case	 Senator I mean I'm not an expert in this matter and maybe we will have to do defer to dr. threats but my understanding is that you can you can and indeed I am a smoker myself and I have in the past on occasions quit successfully and I don't find that a particularly different difficult experience it's tough on occasions but it's something which I think people can do with a little bit of resolve so on that basis I really find it difficult to label it or put it in the same category as crack cocaine or heroin	 getting all due respect it's the question isn't whether you put it in the classification of crack cocaine and heroin it's whether you believe it's addictive or not and I think most Americans believe that it is addictive perhaps not as addictive as cocaine or heroin but certainly something that is very difficult to stop and has addictive aspects to it I say that from personal experience well things are perhaps I could help you I mean I should be prepared to accept that most Americans would	 certainly label smoking is Addicted by their use of the term I'm simply saying that I think that's so inclusive a term as to be almost meaningless and I would prefer to retain that word for things which are more appropriately labeled addictive such as hard drugs and cocaine yet I hope you understand there's a lot of symbology associated with this particular aspect of the issue and I hope you appreciate that mr. Goldstone	 chairman at the house my house testimony was very this very simple that I thought that as a Layman I'm not a scientist but as a Layman I thought that I've always thought and I was a smoker that cigarette smoking is habit forming as I think most Americans believe that kind of activity or that that is addictive and that's how I see it	 thank you mr. gear yes Senator I just divided the Houston under some definitions of addiction used today nicotine would be considered addictive we certainly recognize that that is a predominant Public Health Point of View and in this agreement we've agreed to put that addiction warning on the packages so that the general public or the consumers receiving buying the product would receive that message I understand the agreement my question was do you consider it addictive senator	 we consider it more of a habit than then I would consider it addictive	 Bible mr. chairman before the again I would ask the witnesses there's a lot of symbology associated with this question and it's reason why it's my first question go ahead and but I understand that mr. chairman back in October Senator hatch ask the companies to submit to him our views on this matter which we did and we've gone public on that and I could read you the two or three paragraphs which we submitted to settle to hatch well I would	 reciate if you adjust I'll try to sell it to summarize then as I did at the house committee and I said at the house committee that we recognize that nicotine is found in cigarette smoke has mild pharmacological effects and that under some definitions cigarette smoking is addictive thank you mr. fish I would agree that under some definitions of his effective Senator thank you some have suggested that unless the industry receives some liability protection you would challenge any	 marketing restrictions	 I guess and I think this is an equally important question suppose that the Congress acted	 without any liability immunity for the cigarette industry would you then challenge any marketing restrictions that would be imposed either by regulatory agency or by law and would you do so by legal challenge mr. Brooks oh start with mr. Tisch	 well since more than 95% of the consumers of cigarettes are adults we've been asked to give up all our first amendment's amendment rights for the majority of our smokers the predominant majority of smokers are adults so I think we would have a very difficult time not asking for our first amendment rights	 maintaining them in light of that situation	 to Bible Well I would agree with what mr. to said mr. chairman I'd also add that I think there would be other parties who have an involvement in this who might also challenge it such as advertising agencies and others so I don't think it's something just unique to the tobacco industry	 but Mr Bible my question was would you then consider a challenge to any restrictions on marketing if the liability immunity aspect of the agreement was not enacted by Congress yes I believe I'd be obliged to settle it because mr. chairman because I have a fiduciary responsibility to my stockholders also and I think 97 percent of smokers in the United States are adults and I'd like to	 taking the right to advertise my products to adults in a responsible fashion and I believe there is room for advertising and responsible fashion	 skier Center I think we'd have to see what the restrictions were if in fact we thought that they were a violation of First Amendment rights on commercial free speech and I think we'd have to consider what actions we would take	 so you aren't necessarily saying you automatically would challenge well I mean I could see there are a number of things in this proposed resolution on access and that that I don't think we would have a problem with I think there are a number of things that we were asked to voluntarily give up people in advertising and other kinds of things that if this deal broke a product I don't think we'd probably be willing to do that	 it's called Stone Senator this is our first amendment rights to communicate with our customers as I said in my opening statement for consumer product you speak a little more into the microphone is called Stone from First Amendment rights which include as a consumer product company communicating with your customer it's critical to us it's invaluable there is I could not conceive of the circumstances that I with a for the fiduciary duties that I have to my stockholders employees and others	 conceivably give those up and at the same time have the burdens of regulations our company wouldn't survive so I'd have to assert my constitutional rights mr. Brooks regrettably I would have to concur with both mr. Bible mr. Goldstone German even if those restrictions were restrictions of advertising to children	 Gemini don't believe that Brian Williams in currently Dazzle has done historically for that matter targeted children with our advertising regrettably advertising about products do occasionally by dint of being advertising are made aware to have people under age of smoking age or indeed under drinking age or whatever else it might be and that is always a risk with with advertising but if there was a way of closely tailoring some restrictions that would ensure that all we were doing	 it was avoiding any risk of advertising to children I'd certainly want to look at that before instructing my lawyers to assert our first amendment rights but I think my position is broadly that in line with mr. girls do know mr. Bibles Center for	 let's chairman I'm not sure	 that I understand this that the question is with we put into legislation First Amendment rights restrictions would they go to court	 well they didn't somebody else would because once you put the nose under the camels nose Under the Tent that somebody else is going to be doing it we find the attorney-client privilege today and all that stuff going down the drain Center for Cancer without taking from your time Senator Ford could I respond as you know there are many people who have advocated that the immunity from liability be completely dropped I think that we as a committee have to examine the ramifications of that	 proposal that's being made and that's the reason why I directed The Well I understand that and I appreciate what Chairman's doing the As I understood it that under the First Amendment rights in the June 20-something settlement that there was a protocol I'm not sure our side agreement that would be signed to get around the first amendment problems	 and so I that's what I think we're going to have to do here I don't believe we can legislate and I'm not a lawyer I am on jury however but that we can legislate that without the possibility going to court and I was I want to say one thing the doctor Koop surprised me and I didn't quite understand he didn't put nicotine in the same category as cocaine and crack and all that and one of our colleagues asked him why not	 said you can't overdose on nicotine	 and so I think there is some at least research the scientific knowledge as its separate the two and so I think you have to be careful one thing that that you know I'm trying to fight I want a reasonable bill and I think we could sit down to table and probably do the same thing that you did with the attorneys General well we don't find that around your everybody your day on so they want to kick the hell out of you and every time they kick the	 goes up a little bit and I resent that and I think they're out to be worked out but let me if if anybody hits the table can tell me if we do away with the tobacco program do away with the tobacco program	 how many of the 60	000 Farm families in my state would be left to grow tobacco anybody have any idea somebody said that one Economist said it would only be about 10% that'd be 6	000 reduces 60 down to six and they all become large farms and would deal direct with the manufacturer and around the warehouse people it would that be a correct assumption	 well I'll have a go at it if I may mr. chair I like your goals okay it's your stops IT worried me it's it depending on what elasticity you would use in predicting industry volume you could see industry volume declines ranging between 25% and 40% over a five-year period and higher over a 10-year period	 no doubt if the industry volume reduction they'll be less usage of tobacco therefore less need for tobacco therefore less Growers to try to put a number on the number of Growers I couldn't do that because it depends on the size of the allotments but I would say it's fair to say that there would be a significant reduction in the amount of tobacco grown maybe with exports of tobacco some of that could be	 offset but I think the significance would be high based on the proposed resolution of June 20 if that were changed and it would be higher I have been told that it would be more likely that smaller Farmers would go out of business more likely that larger Farms would be developed such as we saw in the dairy industry and they might be in other state of Kentucky	 anybody else have anything that they want to comment to that I just feel if we do away with the tobacco program and as I said we have several Health units that have joined with us to keep the tobacco program as it is today and administered by USDA but if we do away with the program and we have all these large farms and as we would say down in Kentucky we grow tobacco from fencerow to fencerow	 some say that the price of tobacco would reduce this as Hi-C be reduced as high as 70 cents per pound is there any anyone wanted challenge that or agree with it or say anything different	 well I would say my own sin I'm sure glad you're there to table Miss clavel well I'll have a shot my own senses in that environment tobacco prices would come down more to the level of World prices 70 cents may be a bit extreme but it would come down Burley tobacco as you know right now is in somewhat short supply that will be corrected other thought in the coming year or two but there would be a decline in my opinion in the price of tobacco	 some say as high as 70 per-- 70% per pound and if that's true then the tobacco companies would have a windfall of about a billion a year	 because you be paying me I could say senator I don't want that windfall	 I mean I don't want you to have it either you know we're so let's work together to make sure we don't get this win for because we certainly don't want it what we're doing here now if we do away with the program and it restricts and give through a program and and rules and regulations restrict the growth that tobacco it does however keep the price support and tobacco an hour and those are the two things that help the groups that have agreed to this won't you know and so that's what	 Farmers want that's what they tell me and so I just bankruptcy bothers me you could handle the and the keys to us today and we wouldn't pay for the first year or some of the programs that we bills have been introduced out here and I think somehow or another that we said that righteous indignation of the tobacco industry's turned into greed and they see the best opportunity in 20 years to get money off of you guys so they	 can fund all these programs out here that sound good I like them myself you know but funny money we've got ten States in recent months to raise their excise tax one day 80 cents 12 a dollar New Jersey 40% is those 10 states you got four initiatives on California ballot this fall that even reforming schools you know they're cool reform at there's a dollar per pack on cigarettes and all that's going to be gone for we ever get a chance to	 any money you know so it's just we're at the Funny Money somebody somewhere has to have the Charisma and the ability to bring us all together and work out something that's acceptable and the politics is Art of the doable right now we don't have any things doable and it's all politics is no Art thank you mr. chairman now thank you senator for it and you are vital part of that effort certainly as far as Charisma is concerned I want I want to I want to	 I want to assure you that if I've got Charisma let's use him as germinal Center forward you are very important and I want to assure you that it is I have every intention for us to move forward and I believe that we can I believe that on this committee we've established a bipartisan working effort that I believe that we can and will and should and I you and I agree that the American people would not look kindly on us if at the end of this year we had not addressed the	 shoo of children smoking doctor Frist thank you mr. chairman	 as a physician I have obviously	 some experience but a great deal of personal feelings having operated on thousands of patients that I interpret the etiology of their disease being related to to smoking as a heart surgeon and as a lung surgeon being from a tobacco State the same issues that that we just heard discussed where I've got twenty four to thirty thousand Farmers farming families where Hauser's very concerned about their future	 anything that we do here this past Saturday I spent four hours at my children's school I have an eight-year-old ten-year-old 12 year old and 14 year old and over that four hours it was it was the parents talking about just say no and how one says no at that particular age aimed at a variety of behaviors but the one that people kept coming back to again was was was smoking	 as an adult American clearly people have the the the our should have the freedom to buy a legal product and to smoke or use a legal product and it wearing each of those hats I have a number of very quick questions coming back to to senator forgeline of discussions and I guess let me address this to mr. Brooks Goldstone and Bible if we did go to a free market	 two questions number one knowing the elasticity of demand and assuming that the price of tobacco would go down what would that do to a the number of smokers in this country and be what would it do to your strategic planning for your company would you go into the growing business once clearly these small farms would consolidate into larger Farms so what impact would that have financially on your company let me mr. Brooks let me start with you if	 went to a free market and the price of tobacco went down what would that do to the number of smokers in this country knowing what you know about elasticity of demand well I didn't think it would impact the smokers Percy Senator but it certainly would be a concern to me despite my accent I do live and work in Kentucky I'm certainly aware of the concerns of the 60	000 families that Senator Ford referenced and I do believe that the industry wants constructively to find a solution to the issues that you and hero Thrace I think we can	 and I think hopefully we have put some proposals forward as to how this might be encompassed within the resolution if we did get a free market if that was the way that the country decided what would your prediction Beyond number of smokers in this company in the country no effect none that I can foresee right sitting at and financially to your company what would you do what would you predict well the resolution is going to impose very severe Financial penalties I suspect this would this would be just if we went to a free market in terms of the purchase of tobacco tobacco growing	 perhaps I should just emphasize that American Tobacco is still the best tobacco in the world there will always be a demand for good American Tobacco and we will certainly want to go on buying it and putting it in our blood percentage d by American what percentage do you have well I have to just double-check a back on that but it's around I think between 50 and 60 percent but I have to just double-check to make sure that was an accurate statement	 okay so basically the price dropped in terms of how much you had to pay for tobacco what would that happen to number of smokers do you know well that's a central Council it would have an immediate impact and mr. galsten if in theory the price drops and you just took that and translated that out obviously that's going to go counter to what people are talking about about raising price of tobacco but I think for us anyone who is in the industry and understand	 even my short time and understands the importance in terms of quality of American leaf and how critical that is to our product that what the potential disaster in terms of economic chaos is of nobody really can predict what could happen to the farmers and I think from our point of view we need to have as part of this a viable Support Program we're going to have to figure out how to do it if we did if we did away with the support program would do you think the prices would fall would you agree with	 premise that they would fall I think it's very likely I think what first happens is you really have chaos and in in the dislocation of families of farms of communities when you try to pick up the pieces you probably are going to have falling prices but you'll have even worse you'll have dislocations in Supply right if the prices fell it would be a windfall maybe initially but eventually your prices would come down does that with that increase in number of smokers	 for those who believe that the price is the lower the price the more the smokers that obviously runs counter to the public health agenda you do you believe that I have no doubt the same way I've said to you that if we raise prices or volume in ourselves and our earnings are going to drop there's no question about that I mean that's just law of supply and demand that happens everywhere mr. Barba could I dissect the question little please Senator I think if you raise the prices of cigarettes as is proposed in the proposed	 solution here will industry volume will come down they'll be less tobacco grown if you maintain the price support program that exists today then although they'll be less tobacco grown there would be organized I think an organized fashion of dealing with the farmers and I would like to think very strongly that under the proposed resolution we could help accommodate the difficulties that that would pose on the other hand if you did not raise the prices in accordance with the proposed resolution here and there	 only singular Act was to abandon the stabilization program then prices of tobacco would certainly come down I think that would damage the tobacco growing industry would damage tobacco Growers so I think if you were to do that you would need to set in place some form of compensation scheme for tobacco growers in at that price came down do you think that the number of smokers would increase in the country yes clearly there is an elasticity associated with the price of cigarettes in my opinion and it prices go up volume comes down if prices go down	 volume goes up mr. galsten well I had told you I spent four hours in the meeting	 discussing how you tell your children to say no to to various lifestyle Behavior challenging time in everybody's life what do what do you tell a 12 year old today about specifically about smoking and tobacco health and behavior	 well first of all Senator when you specially if you're talking about your own child I think it's very hard to tell your own child anything if you are doing something else	 doesn't mean you can't but I think example is a very important part of it and and being honest with how you think about it I try to be I was before I got this job and I am today fairly open with my children about what I think about that product and why as children they shouldn't even be thinking about it or making decisions about it and and I believe it has an impact honesty and straightforwardness helps	 and help what do you tell them for health when they say well does the smoking her hurt you	 I tell them in fact I just ended up talking about it the other day with my twelve-year-old again about my own personal beliefs about the fact that I stopped smoking because I thought even though I enjoyed it very much but in balancing the risks I thought I was taking to my health ultimately it came out on the side of stopping smoking for me and Miss Brooks will you tell you your 12 year old I don't have a twelve-year-old Senator but if I did I would certainly hope that I would explain that smoke	 was clearly an adult custom that it there are risks health risks associated with smoking very clearly I would Endeavour to persuade him or her not to not to even consider the issue until they became of age 18 and at age 18 what would you tell I was sides is their right to choose what did you tell them about their health but the health effects of smoking well I would my position on the health effects of smoking wouldn't have changed that smoking is a risk factor for all these diseases and that is something which they	 they should weigh in the balance before before deciding whether to or not to smoke but if they're adults of that point it certainly as you rightly say would be their decision which Bible you on come on oh oh go ahead go ahead well I have three quite adult children and they don't smoke but I have a three-year-old granddaughter and I hope that I live long enough to see the time when she reaches an age when I could have a sensible discussion with her and I would certainly tell her about the risk associated with smoking	 and that's something she shouldn't contemplate until she was an adult and can form a sensible decision where do you ever want her to smoke no I didn't think I'd ever want her to smoke but I'd certainly understand if she chose to it's her decision if she wishes to thank you mister	 and a wide thank you mr. chairman mr. Goldstone the current edition of the Journal of American Medicine again cites the problem of advertisements as it relates to attracting children to smoking and cites the prospect of hundreds of thousands of premature deaths as a result of these ads would you commit this morning to the committee to not using the Joe Camel add overseas	 in marketing and promotional activity	 I'm not sure I necessarily it's kind of a broad question the since you've started with a children you don't have to agree with the Journal of American Medical Association the question is will you commit this morning to not using the Joe Camel advertising promotion overseas Senator I our company does not use Joe Camel in the United States because of judgments we made about	 whether it was in the interest of the company my own judgment was it's not in the interest of the company to use it overseas camel we have an advertising campaign that is not Joe Camel we have a national advertising campaign and I have no reason to believe that we will be using Joe Camel in our advertising overseas	 mr. Brooks a question for you I was in the house during the hearings when it came to light that your company was using substance known as y1 a genetically engineered a high nicotine plant when that was brought to light the company said that it would no longer use it now there have been reports that your company is secretly continuing its use of	 I won after telling the Congress that you were not in fact the top blender mr. Roger black took the Fifth Amendment for a portion of his deposition dealing with this genetically engineered High nicotine plant my first question for you is is brown and Williamson or baat using y1 tobacco for cigarettes in any country	 so I can I just start by saying I have to refute most of the statements you made in your opening remark but I'm very happy to just leave it like that and Carry On and answer your questions directly or if you'd like me to say why I disagree with your Obama so you do this these are a matter of public record and seen the deposition he took the Fifth Amendment so let's just go to the questions is Brown & Williamson using y1 tobacco for cigarettes in any country now Ron Williamson as a result of the	 things still believe very responsible project it entered into in the mid 80s to early 90s does have a small amount of tobacco leaf I think we have seven million pounds of did have back in 1995 and we have been generally working that stop pile off in very limited inclusions in a number of Our Brands both domestic us Brands and one brand will be exported overseas how much of it is being sold	 in this country and how much is being sold overseas precisely I find that quite difficult to to work out off the cuff but I can sure I could provide the committee and yourself with any information that's helpful isn't y1 about getting the right dose of nicotine to the smoker no sir it's not a move if you ask me about the origin of y1 I do have to give you the full story I'm afraid and if I could take the Indulgence of the committee just to have a couple moments to do that I have I have only only 5 minutes of	 I wish to hear you out and if it could be brief I'll try to be as brief as possible so this was a project that was first suggested to us by Health authorities on both sides of the Atlantic indeed a government agency the National Cancer institute's tobacco working party proposed to the industry at large that we should find acceptable ways of producing rather acceptable lotar products for consumers and one path suggested by the NCI was indeed that we should find	 a way of producing lower tar cigarettes at whilst maintaining the amount of nicotine in those cigarettes this was taken up / not directly by Brown & Williamson but by the US Department of Agriculture who produced the variety of tobacco is now known as y1 and offered the seed to Industry members I believe Ron Williamson took up that offer and subsequently succeeded in producing a tobacco plant that would actually stand up in the field and which would could be harvested commercially progressively when we	 I to blend cigarettes including y1 in pursuit of his NCI concept we found that consumers just did not like the taste of the product and subsequently we decided to discontinue growing why when tobacco and discontinued the project Itself by that time we had some seven million pounds of the tobacco it's perfectly good through here tobacco which is not if I may just clarify the record genetically engineered and we are simply working it off in very small levels of inclusion in	 domestic and Export programs well I again come back to the fact that the FDA investigators found in 1994 that this in fact was a genetically engineered High nicotine plant the company said it would no longer use it it's now being used according to what you've told us and certainly according to this deposition where your top blender took the Fifth Amendment and I will tell you gentlemen it is this kind	 end of case that makes many of us in the Congress skeptical that it is actually a new day with respect to the subject this is not an issue that goes back 25 years this is an issue of the company telling United States Congress it wouldn't do something something that the FDA found represented a serious health problem and now the company has gone to doing it again gentleman I want to wrap up my first	 and that one last question I think I'd like to just go down the row with respect to this matter of international promotion of tobacco and sales overseas when I would like to know is whether each of you as a CEO of your company is willing to terminate officials particularly contractors who were involved with your company in selling to Children overseas	 and perhaps I could start with with you mr. Tisch it's very easy Senator we have no overseas involvements at all	 your Bible employees and contractors yes employees employees don't sell cigarettes to individuals generally they sell them to wholesalers or to retailers so that wouldn't apply in employees contractors could be for example a distributor they distribute to retail stores who then sell to customers so Distributors wouldn't be selling to individuals I think the issue would be	 retailers it is retailers most of the time if not all the time that sells cigarettes to customers if retailers are selling to two children what you need in place is a very strong Access program which is what has been introduced in this country and we're trying to have enforced with even more strength under the proposed resolution Philip Morris worldwide has introduced such programs so far in about 40 countries and we're gearing up	 to do it in every country in the world we're doing it there where we operate in business about 200 markets so to the extent that we can cut off retailers who do that we're setting programs up now so that we can monitor that	 Senator the only Market we have of any substance outside of the u.s. is Canada Canada has a much more restrictive environment today than the US I can tell you that if we found an employee whether in Canada or the US who is violating a sampling code we would take the appropriate action including termination both stone or widen we would fire anyone in our company	 Hound evading or policies about selling to Children And as far as people whom we have no control over I think my answer is very similar to mr. Bibles which would mean you would terminate a contractual relationship mean a lot of this is semantics and employees and contractors we followed the house hearings closely and I'm concerned that people with whom you have a contractual relationship you would we be willing to terminate that relationship	 patient ship if they sell the miners what again I don't have in my head completely and I want to be careful about just because I'm not sure I can give you a fair answer I'd have to think about the kinds of people we might have contractual relations to I think what I can tell you for sure is we would fire any employee anyone whom I employ anybody who we have control over and as to the kind of people I'm trying to think of who we have this relationships with by contract	 on that one Senator I'd prefer to do some research myself and write to you and get back to you with an answer	 Senator I think I can confirm as well we have a policy that we do not promote our products to kids are underage smokers and that would be a terminable offense we would terminate somebody who clearly has evaded that policy and indeed I think we have historically terminated contractors who have done so in this channel	 enter Brian	 thank you very much mr. chairman	 gentlemen I would hope that this Congress would be an ape would be able to enact a legislation to resolve this issue	 but it strikes me that a good part of our problem is that you are having difficulty escaping from your history and some of us on the committee are having difficulty forget it I thought the Chairman's question were here e dude the issue of whether or not you believe nicotine to be addictive is somewhat illustrative of a situation here I didn't think your responses were particularly candid but assuming for the sake of argument that generically and one for	 another you do believe that it's addictive it seems to me that the industry which is trying to present a Kinder and gentler and more conciliatory images trying to have it both ways I do not know Walker merryman he is often described as an individual who is the voice of the industry but he was asked about your testimony before the House Effect it the executives of the leading tobacco companies America testify before the house that	 tobacco was or the brother nicotine was addictive his answered no they didn't say that what strikes me you're trying to have it both ways and I find that very Troublesome in terms of your credibility mr. Bible let me ask you a specific question that concerns the use of cartoon advertising my understanding and correct me if I'm wrong is that the proposed settlement would ban cartoon advertising my correct tribal yes the	 purrs resolution eliminates cartoon figures and human figures in all advertising well that was my understanding and again as an example of where I think the industry is compounding the difficulty for us in reaching a settlement I do not know this gentleman either but a Meyer cop low who presumably is a spokesman for your company Council this was in a USA Today article that appeared earlier this year so we're not talking about	 out ancient history February 18 1998 warned that the industry might return to practices such as cartoon advertising if Congress fails to Grant protections from lawsuits now if he is accurately quoted I must say that is outrageous you all have indicated to us in one form or another that you do not Target children that to the extent that your company has done so in the past you disassociate yourself from	 that kind of conduct and then we hear these kinds of statements I must say I find that very very difficult to understand why that statement would be made if indeed there is a change in attitude and let me give you a chance to mr. Bible to either disassociate yourself from that statement or to explain why that statement would purportedly be made on behalf of your company well first the I doubt the statement was made and I really would urge that somebody	 check that but I would also like to say that Philip Morris to the best of my knowledge as never used cartoon characters in advertising senator	 let me just go up and down the line here very quickly yes or no answer I mean for some reason this issue was not resolved at lingered over to the next Congress are all of you indicating to me that you would enter this committee that you would not use cartoon advertising I was to Brooke some start with you I can see no circumstance in the future in which we would want to use content advertising trolls dumb I have no no intent to do that and I would also find it the sir I can't conceive of the circumstance	 Senator we haven't used cartoons and we don't intend to do that	 we haven't used cartoons and we certainly never intend to use them well I appreciate that I don't think it's particularly helpful if indeed this is an accurate statement for you to come before the Congress as an industry and make a presentation indicating that you are renouncing a course of conduct that some at least a pursuit in the past and that the kind of threatened us that if you don't go along with this deal that we may resume it again I don't think it's helpful so to the extent that that kind of conduct is occurring it kind of reminds me	 as a former prosecutor of the good cop bad cop you all come in here and make presentations to us and our conciliatory in your approach that other things are apparently being said in different contexts to so that is that is one point that I want to make let me ask you a couple of quick questions about about the settlement itself now again I think mr. Bible you had indicated that there is no limitation on claims if I understood your testimony correctly and I	 suspect that is true but there is an aggregate limit each year would you not concede that if a number of claims were filed and if judgments were secured on those claims that it is possible that an individual claimants amount of recovery would be limited by the cap that is placed in this proposed to settlement either kept Senator I'm very glad you asked that question because it's been a great deal of confusion about that	 the answer to your question is no under the proposed resolution up to five billion dollars a year each year will be made available to satisfy any judgments which would be 1 by individual claimants there is also a provision there that in the event that any judgment exceeded 1 million dollars and if the five billion dollars were totally consumed in that year than the excess over million would roll into the next year so that	 judgment would always be satisfied so the answer to your question is no in other words you would simply defer perhaps the date of collection but that ultimately the full amount of any judgment would be satisfied exactly so for example if it were one and a half million dollars and the the total fund we used up in the first year you get 1 million in year 15 hundred thousand dollars in YouTube	 Goldstone you raise the question that you think that this agreement has been unfairly criticized and I gathered by implication where he hasn't been given a fair opportunity to be considered I'm sure you're aware of the fact that dr. Koop not the Surgeon General of this Administration has appeared before this committee and other committees in the Congress and has raised among other objections three that I recall a number one that the look back Provisions are	 inadequate for those who do not understand the technical nuances I understand that to be the process by which we judge how effectively we have reduced the level of teenage smoking that was one of his criticisms the second criticism he says that the agreement as entered into unduly limits the ability of the FDA and third he said it does not require a full disclosure of the documents because my time is limited let me just ask you to respond to those	 those criticisms	 you know I think of senator of all the things that have happened since we've had this agreement the most surprising to me how you get the photographer to remain so mr. Goldstone I might have eye contact thank you sir you're entitled to that and so much yeah the most surprising to me and Frankie the most disappointing is the doctor coops reaction to this agreement because I've said it before I really look at this	 we need from a regulatory point of view and it is truly a public health Advocates dream come true there isn't one provision that has ever been talked about for 15 years that isn't in this agreement and when the doctor Koop and when the president announced the FDA regulations two years ago which are still being litigated in court those regulations aren't half as tough as the regulatory scheme that's	 set out in this agreement it's got everything now very quickly this look back provision I heard dr. Koop say that and he used I think he said something like this is only six cents a pack or eight cents a pack and it sounds like a little amount of money but the fact is it was calculated to be all the prophets a tobacco company could conceivably make from an underage smoker for all that smokers life	 now what more could you want and taking away incentive and by the way if you then look it's not 8 cents a pack if you calculate the penalty for the underage smoker comes to something like a couple of dollars a pack so it's significant and also if you go on again unduly limits the FDA Public Health Advocates dream come true and on full disclosure it is all documents everything and you know Senator the last thing I'll say about this is	 talked a little bit today about Brown and Williamson when Senator Wyden was talking about ingredients and tobacco use and I was thinking to myself when they were going through that colloquy my goodness if we have this proposed regulation they'll be more no more discussion about that the government will be in those factories the government will decide good manufacturing practices and that's the end of it we won't have discussions anymore of whether their cartoon characters or whether these appeal to Children anymore because they'll be no advertising	 sizing we're giving up our constitutional rights so when I look at dr. Koop I say what more he hasn't won said well I want this regulation this regulation is not in the package it's a public health Advocates dream and I really hope sometimes it's hard after 40 years of war to say enough	 I really hope that dr. Koop dr. Kessler and some of those others who want to continue fighting we'll take a look at this and say you know what it's time to put the weapons down these guys really have given up they want a Cooperative new day	 thank you very much Sharon	 Rockefeller Senator Kerry was here earlier and return so according to the Early Bird rule will go to Senator Kerry	 thank you mr. chairman	 I like to First pursue the question of the degree to which you are quote sort of in a new posture and sense giving up or coming to the table someone among you I think it might have been mr. Bible talked earlier about good corporate citizenship etcetera I gather one or two of my colleagues may have asked some questions about the the current advertising but I'm struck by the fact that	 despite the fact that you've come to the table and despite the fact that you are acknowledging this sort of new posture there is not a voluntary willingness or acknowledgement of the need to change the way you advertising whether or not there is an agreement	 and I've been frankly quite taken aback by some of the statements I think mr. Bible it was mr. your attorney mr. Meyer Coppola was quoted in USA Today as essentially warning us that the tobacco industry might return to practices such as cartoon advertising if we failed to Grant the tobacco industry protection from lawsuits so let me try to clarify this today if we can it speaking	 our company so I mean first of all mr. Bible is your lawyer threatening the Congress that you will return to advertising if we don't	 accept the terms that have been put in front of us as Senator I said in response to an earlier question that I doubt the veracity of that report in USA Today and I'd urge you to have it checked out we have never used cartoon figures in our advertising to the best of my knowledge we don't plan to so I don't think there's any substance in the comet but I just would like to make one comment if you don't mind you know you talked about the companies of said There Will	 do nothing about the advertising you're back in 1995 Philip Morris introduced on its own initiative a program called action against taxes which was a mess
