when I think about it most of my friends who smoke have become more and more considerate of people like me who don't so when I read Amendment one I wondered whether we were being fair to them raising taxes by 50 Cents a pack seems a little high then it puts a sales tax on cigarettes and let cities and counties tax tobacco with no limits isn't that a lot of money from one group to pay for programs that should be everyone's responsibility before you vote Reid Amendment one that ask yourself is it really fair,we the people of color on our state constitution for 157 years it's kept our democratic ideals and principles and protected our individual rights so why would we put tobacco taxes and Health Care spending programs into it the tobacco amendment is a constitutional amendment it makes Health Care spending programs and three new tobacco taxes permanent parts of Colorado's Constitution vote no on the tobacco tax amendment because even if your for the spending programs in new taxes they don't belong in our constitution,ballot initiatives can be confusing so before you vote read proposition 200 carefully then ask yourself is a 90 million dollar tax increase on smokers really fair where will the money go and why would we give Millions to bureaucrats without any controls on how it's bent prop 200 has a lot of problems but don't take my word for it copies of prop 200 are available in the Secretary of State's office so you can read it and make the right choice,paid for by the no more taxes committee majority of funding provided by the tobacco industry and the tobacco Institute, paid for by the no more taxes committee majority of funding provided by the tobacco industry and the tobacco Institute kozeny Californians they raise Millions by taxing smokers but look how they spent the money five hundred thousand dollars to sponsor a race car they wasted even more money sponsoring floats and parades they even paid for a five-day pool party cool now they want to do the same thing in Arizona vote no on Prop 200 wasting tax money is one California idea we don't need bummer, Arizona's cancer Heart and Lung association's and 200,000 Arizona citizens worked hard to place proposition 200 the tobacco tax on the ballot now the tobacco companies are paying us a visit and they're dressing up for the occasion they're coming to protect their profits by trying to defeat the tobacco tax and they're going to mislead the public under the cloak of deception don't let the tobacco companies pull the wool over your eyes paid for by a healthy future Healthcare Providers and the Arizona Hospital Association, it's a shame isn't it most of them started smoking so young and they weren't told that the nicotine in cigarettes could keep them hooked forever but now we know how to keep tobacco out of the hands of kids we can prevent vending machine sales and crack down on Merchants who sell to minors we can also raise the cost of cigarettes through change in public policy and increase education about the effects of smoking and when fewer children are smoking will all breathe a little easier on your mom will love those flowers are mom she's doing okay, you're sick and tired of the cigarette prism the one of us to sell cigarettes which all the more wages they say they're not advertising cigarettes to children but kids recognize Joe Camel nearly as much as Mickey Mouse or even giving us a mother had named I'd like to give those compasso companies a piece of my mind I told him what a battery Stones they are on the kids in Arizona we will Camp was don't smoke and kids shouldn't either
