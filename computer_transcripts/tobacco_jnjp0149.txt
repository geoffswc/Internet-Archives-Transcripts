but we're back on the record for the beginning of take two of the best fishing doctor lilies approximately 214 question has arisen here about an exhibit that has been introduced in the barn class action and whether or not that exhibit has been introduced or I mean has been produced in Washington mr. Butler and I have agreed to not resolve it today and to pursue it outside the confines of the spectrum,back and placed under seal conclusion that position in accordance with what may or may not be its proper designation is highly confidential until that issue is resolved in the washing the negation Council and way that she won't see it we'll get it worked out outside the confines of that but thank you thank you dr. Lily I just want to clear one matter up I believe that you testified earlier that, at or about the time that you were involved in the art process you were of the opinion that that the delivered nicotine into the body was not a primary reason why people smoke correct yes that's correct and then when I read the sentence out of what's been marked as a little exhibit one that says that a primary, people smoke is to deliver nicotine into their bodies you told me that you agreed with that sentence that and I asked you in fact whether you sit here today you agree with that sense is your opinion about the role of nicotine changed over the years objection Jonathan you're going to read the sentence read it I mean please read it right okay what's it say you said a primary reason the sentence says the primary reason, your opinion about the role of nicotine changed over the years I used to have a lot of discussions with Bill done about the fact that I never fully accepted and by the way if you're an hour and the you can have an opinion on everything that from my personal standpoint I felt that was the reason that that I smoke cigarettes I think there's been a lot of scientific, soon as of light and I certainly when I recognized what was said here even though this was written I assume in 92 or some time I would say that the majority of scientific people in the country probably would agree with the sentence number two and that's where I was coming from, when you say a majority would agree with that sentence don't you think it would be actually more accurate to say the overwhelming majority agree though with that sentence injection Foundation speculation and yeah I really I really don't act, were you aware at or about this company at or about the time that this document was drafted anybody in the, project table group expressing an opinion that that sentence the second sentence, was incorrect, you know I don't remember I mean I don't remember us sitting down and discussing as a body this this I mean we certainly heard a lot of discussion someone from people in the company who were not part of the group concerning everything from nicotine patches through the history of cigarettes but I really don't remember it being polled at a meeting saying to you agree with this or don't but you don't recall anyone say that, that that that sentence should be taken out of the document because it's fat it's not a correct statement of believe that question at their that is not a correct statement no I never heard anyone say they would you think it's a fair characterization doctor Lu to call a cigarette and nicotine delivery, every system objection vague, Jackson calls for an opinion, well I mean it certainly delivers naked thing among other things but it delivers nicotine so so it's fair to call it a get sick of tea delivery it would be a description that in my mind would be okay and nicotine of course is a drug is it not, if you mean is it physiological or at least active well I think that certainly but let the what witness finish objection gets interpose before the answer what's the objection become the witness calls for an expert opinion lacks Foundation, I think you are being a Raider of the scientific literature I would say it's certainly as mentioned act in the central nervous system and therefore is it fair to call a cigarette a drug delivery system potential drug delivery be nicotine objection form and I think you have to just be specific as to definition for this you can answer I mean personally I could see that that could be a, option I could call it at our delivery system also sure I think a lot of that depends on how you want to characterize sure, duck, dr. Lilly, you are familiar with Jeffrey Bible of course right now yes sir you probably have heard I assume that Jeffrey Bible was questioned in a deposition in a case in Florida a couple weeks ago yes the news yes I just want to read you one question answer that was part of that deposition and ask you, whether you agree with mr. Bible's answer to the question he was asked quote would Phillip Morris agree that a single American citizen who smoked their products for 30 years or more has ever died of disease caused in part by smoking cigarettes he answered I think there's a fair chance that one would have I'd like to know whether you agree with the statement that mr. Bible gave which was in response to that question, I think there's a fair chance that one would have is that something you agree with let me just are you asking him for his opinion as his personal opinion as to that underlying factual question exactly not as to Fillmore's but as to dr. Lily well as to dr. Lily Senior Management and R&D and felt more sure well I'm not asking you as as the grandfather to his for six-year-olds, that I can tell you so you can take that any way you want it you can answer that well I just make sure John you're not asking him whether he believes mr. Bible was telling the truth or not right correct I'm not asking you to to opine on Mister Bibles Integrity on whether that's in fact what he believes I've been asking you whether or not, you agree with the response that there is a fair chance that one would have died one being an American died from smoking cigarettes that Philip Morris manufactured when I say died I mean in The Identical let me let me let me rephrase it because as usual we've had some interference right so let's let's try to get it all right stop, go off the Record we get newcomer judge the judge on the phone we're back on the regular approximately 225, let me ask you as a senior manager a senior a senior manager at Philip Morris in their R&D Department this question, would you agree dr. Lily that a single American citizen, who has smoked the Philip Morris product, has died in part because they were smoking cigarettes I'm going to reject a basis of lack of foundation to be on this Witnesses competence I believe it calls for an expert opinion this witness is not been proffered as an expert in this case and also calls for speculation it's vague and ambiguous as well you can answer, in my opinion for certainly I don't speak for Philip Morris and toxicology
