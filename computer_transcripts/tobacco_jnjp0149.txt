but we're back on the record for the beginning of take two of the best fishing doctor lilies approximately 214 question has arisen here about an exhibit that has been introduced in the barn class action and whether or not that exhibit has been introduced or I mean has been produced in Washington mr. Butler and I have agreed to not resolve it today and to pursue it outside the confines of the spectrum,back and placed under seal conclusion that position in accordance with what may or may not be its proper designation is highly confidential until that issue is resolved in the washing the negation Council and way that she won't see it we'll get it worked out outside the confines of that but thank you thank you dr. Lily I just want to clear one matter up I believe that you testified earlier that, at or about the time that you were involved in the art process you were of the opinion that that the delivered nicotine into the body was not a primary reason why people smoke correct yes that's correct and then when I read the sentence out of what's been marked as a little exhibit one that says that a primary, people smoke is to deliver nicotine into their bodies you told me that you agreed with that sentence that and I asked you in fact whether you sit here today you agree with that sense is your opinion about the role of nicotine changed over the years objection Jonathan you're going to read the sentence read it I mean please read it right okay what's it say you said a primary reason the sentence says the primary reason, your opinion about the role of nicotine changed over the years I used to have a lot of discussions with Bill done about the fact that I never fully accepted and by the way if you're an hour and the you can have an opinion on everything that from my personal standpoint I felt that was the reason that that I smoke cigarettes I think there's been a lot of scientific, soon as of light and I certainly when I recognized what was said here even though this was written I assume in 92 or some time I would say that the majority of scientific people in the country probably would agree with the sentence number two and that's where I was coming from, when you say a majority would agree with that sentence don't you think it would be actually more accurate to say the overwhelming majority agree though with that sentence injection Foundation speculation and yeah I really I really don't act, were you aware at or about this company at or about the time that this document was drafted anybody in the, project table group expressing an opinion that that sentence the second sentence, was incorrect, you know I don't remember I mean I don't remember us sitting down and discussing as a body this this I mean we certainly heard a lot of discussion someone from people in the company who were not part of the group concerning everything from nicotine patches through the history of cigarettes but I really don't remember it being polled at a meeting saying to you agree with this or don't but you don't recall anyone say that, that that that sentence should be taken out of the document because it's fat it's not a correct statement of believe that question at their that is not a correct statement no I never heard anyone say they would you think it's a fair characterization doctor Lu to call a cigarette and nicotine delivery, every system objection vague, Jackson calls for an opinion, well I mean it certainly delivers naked thing among other things but it delivers nicotine so so it's fair to call it a get sick of tea delivery it would be a description that in my mind would be okay and nicotine of course is a drug is it not, if you mean is it physiological or at least active well I think that certainly but let the what witness finish objection gets interpose before the answer what's the objection become the witness calls for an expert opinion lacks Foundation, I think you are being a Raider of the scientific literature I would say it's certainly as mentioned act in the central nervous system and therefore is it fair to call a cigarette a drug delivery system potential drug delivery be nicotine objection form and I think you have to just be specific as to definition for this you can answer I mean personally I could see that that could be a, option I could call it at our delivery system also sure I think a lot of that depends on how you want to characterize sure, duck, dr. Lilly, you are familiar with Jeffrey Bible of course right now yes sir you probably have heard I assume that Jeffrey Bible was questioned in a deposition in a case in Florida a couple weeks ago yes the news yes I just want to read you one question answer that was part of that deposition and ask you, whether you agree with mr. Bible's answer to the question he was asked quote would Phillip Morris agree that a single American citizen who smoked their products for 30 years or more has ever died of disease caused in part by smoking cigarettes he answered I think there's a fair chance that one would have I'd like to know whether you agree with the statement that mr. Bible gave which was in response to that question, I think there's a fair chance that one would have is that something you agree with let me just are you asking him for his opinion as his personal opinion as to that underlying factual question exactly not as to Fillmore's but as to dr. Lily well as to dr. Lily Senior Management and R&D and felt more sure well I'm not asking you as as the grandfather to his for six-year-olds, that I can tell you so you can take that any way you want it you can answer that well I just make sure John you're not asking him whether he believes mr. Bible was telling the truth or not right correct I'm not asking you to to opine on Mister Bibles Integrity on whether that's in fact what he believes I've been asking you whether or not, you agree with the response that there is a fair chance that one would have died one being an American died from smoking cigarettes that Philip Morris manufactured when I say died I mean in The Identical let me let me let me rephrase it because as usual we've had some interference right so let's let's try to get it all right stop, go off the Record we get newcomer judge the judge on the phone we're back on the regular approximately 225, let me ask you as a senior manager a senior a senior manager at Philip Morris in their R&D Department this question, would you agree dr. Lily that a single American citizen, who has smoked the Philip Morris product, has died in part because they were smoking cigarettes I'm going to reject a basis of lack of foundation to be on this Witnesses competence I believe it calls for an expert opinion this witness is not been proffered as an expert in this case and also calls for speculation it's vague and ambiguous as well you can answer, in my opinion for certainly I don't speak for Philip Morris and toxicology sure but I would not disagree that that may have happened okay, dr. Lily I have in front of me your CV that was introducing the ABC case and I note that you've received several awards from Phillip Mars The Silver Ring merit award the Chairman's award the gold ring merit award you received all those Awards correct sir what was the gold ring murder warrant, awarded for, I'm not sure they ride at Pat anything other than pursuing technology of value to the company, I don't think it said anything specific, you've been all with Philip Morris for some 30 something years is that correct 32 yes, is there a one project or well strike that is there a one project that you would say that you're most proud of it felt Mars of your work that you've done, I think I'm happy about the, developing the laser systems for ventilating cigarettes, why does that one come to mind, excuse me developing laser systems to ventilate cigarette filters, I think because it required a lot of understanding about the electromagnetic radiation and how the focus it and particularly how to focus it better than the Divergence out of lasers themselves and to do it at high speed so it was a lot of Technology involved, did you headed up that project yes sir, and what's the significance of ventilating cigarettes, why is that something that you would just that Philip Morris or they felt more Earthly desire to do have in life detection Foundation been lying cigarettes is a way of, bypassing the core of the cigarette to reduce what's generated in the cold and also allows it to be filled and more effectively what's generated in the core that you're trying to avoid five thousand compounds plus CA and there are any of these compounds been found to be carcinogens there's my Foundation, Jackson Vegas ask you can answer I don't think I can list the compounds that are have been found to be officially carcinogens but certainly some of those probably are, is there another project that would come to mind that you would be proud of in particular I know you worked on a lot by working on a lot of projects, no I won't bring up that this one physics when I like but if you like this time domain you like it to bring it back cross could be of terahertz waves Moving on but that was cause I'm a I'm a basically just put to uh down, you want me to continue I don't want to cut you off course I do tell me it to out why that was a this is one that's that's really right out of the drawing board at Bell Telephone Labs that we've been working on basically as an inspection device but, I think I had lots of fun in combustion and pyrolysis and trying to understand those techniques in the early 70s well we were worried when were you working on the combustion process projects, what what time frame was that I was in the non-tobacco business from 67 273 maintaining medical electronics and razor blades and a whole array of things okay 7373 I moved back to the research center and that's when the combustion and pyrolysis work started it how long did you work on that, I was involved in that as the project leader for three years okay submitting to Mid 76 and then then what were the projects that you were working on well in 76 I was put in the ventilation of cigarette project first with electric Spark, and Then followed that up with the lasers that were both commercialized, and how old was the ventilation laser projects going on 76 to win and those were in 219 and 80 when we were putting the plant up down the street here at 20th Street and what did you what kind of projects where you work on in 1980 after that after that, I work for a while on d nitration project the 1880s a let's say mid-1980s, is that the nodd is that naturally occurring tonight that would be called naturally occurring the you nitration and that was 1980 till when I was involved in that, I recently I came over I set up a group I set up a pilot plant, I supervise the running of that around the clock for a few months and I also was working at the same time on the Barclays cigarette controversy with the FTC, tell me a little bit about that Berkeley controversy with the FTC objections to form, well sometime in the, I think it was toward the end of 1980 but don't get mad if I get that date a little bit wrong Brown & Williamson turned out a 1 mg cigarette that most of the people who smoked it felt that it's smoke more like a 15 mg cigarette, and I was asked to look into that to see whether they had a major breakthrough or what was happening, we did look into it and we found out the way they were ventilating the cigarette, led to a condition where when you took a puff your lips secluded the ventilation holes reducing the ventilation to make them guitar rice, and that did not happen when you were doing the FTC test did Philip Morris develop a cigarette in response to the Barclay cigarette that also strike that do they develop cigarette response to the Barclays there right whether never commercialize woman but they sure did do some work on Machinery yes what was the name of that project I don't really recall what the name I whether it even had a name I don't remember that you remember, what the results were of the Barclay cigarette controversy in terms of whether Grand Williams has continued to sell Berkeley and made the same representations about the teen entire levels, I remember correctly, there was the official FTC test included a holder that blocked the maybe half of the holes and so the cigarette got up reported with an asterisk were it would be 1 mg asterick I think eight eight or nine, after the Ino d project, you said you worked on the Barclays conjurer's what else what other projects are we working on the early 80s I worked on the Berkeley thing for a while cause I went to Europe and took the machine we developed the smoke machine you developed a now was called a puff parameter analyzer, and you developed as extra arm I mean I didn't develop it was developed as part of the group that was working on then I got involved in, in lots of things involving new technology is what years are we talking about now I'm talking about here 83 84 what type of new technologies are talking about me return it to me I don't know whether you want me to still hold this, meaning that, we set up a visiting scientist program right we're we effectively tried to bring in outstanding people in all areas of Science in the liver Philip Morris, we set up a lecture program in which we brought again outstanding scientists and many Nobel Prize winners in fact in the lecture and very very wide areas we try to look at a lot of emerging technology to see whether any of it made sense in their, sorry even outside of the business so it was a period of a lots of talking about emerging technology, and that was during the 83-84 time that was kind of in the 83 84 into the 85 time period, what was what kind of projects were you working on after the 83 84 85 time period you just running in 85 I got involved we had some patent infringement suits on are expanded tobacco that I was involved in one was the RJ Reynolds company and when was brown and Williamson, and I spent the whole lot of time and working in those areas he had to deal with lawyers a lot huh they were an occasional lawyer I saw Yes pity what were you doing after that why 1986 I got a pointing to run the D Nick project, and that involved the supercritical extraction yes okay and that took a lot of your time I assume well we were working largely in Bremen Germany so we did that over a period of 18 months I think they were four major trips that took three three to four weeks each and I thought well why was the project or part of the project being done in Germany, what was being done in Germany because the cafe hog people in Germany who decaffeinated coffee had a pretty big size pilot plant in Germany and of the things that were available in the states that was 114 L system in Tarrytown New York, we eventually got like a one liter system in Richmond, then they had the I think this was 175 L system so it was big enough to really do process development, that was in the 1986 that was in January 1986 to July of 1987 at which time we moved back build a pilot plant here and started to plant here, and you were devoted primarily to that project yeah largely to that project that took that took you through what year I took me to Mid 87 and a bit 87 amid 87 I applied for a sabbatical to go to the physics department of Epi something I'd want to do for a while, did you get it yeah I got it I got it approved, and then the bar the Barclays Premier cigarette was in the house and I got it disapproved and but I did work out with VPI to begin doing some research, and which I ended up going up in in 88 and MIT 88 to be pi to be PR and you were at VPI for how long I was at VP I had an apartment there and spent the travel back and forth from Richmond to that apartment for a year and that was in what the 88-89 here that was in the 88 89 period and then you came back to p.m. how was it in back and p.m., and I was back in p.m. when the beta program begin okay that's which was in mid 88 and of course continues today just so the records clear when you were to be Pi you didn't disassociate from p.m. you're on leave or something you know I didn't disassociate we have a sabbatical program not used as often as it should be in my mind, and we have people off we just had a scientist at Oak Ridge for here and it was part of that program okay in 88 other than the beta program what other projects were you devoting your time to 88 and that time no I understand, I think I was spending actually other than interfacing my duties that I interface a lot with universities and with with with speakers I was devoting you know lots of my working time to things like bathing because we were very early in the development of bait, okay where did you start at what point did you take on other projects other than beta because as of right now I understand that the Ada period you were devoting a lot of time to bait I'm wondering what the next well I was I got promoted in 80, fingers in the valley for to research fellow, and his research fellow I did a lot of interfacing with universities I did a lot of interfacing with with people in technology and as I had time going into you know the 80 Thai 88 89 90 I spent a lot of time with basic research contracts at various universities, everything from are saw growth to catalysis to just basic physics and I did a lot of kind of mentoring of the young people in technology was also in charge of basically the planning certainly the technology planning at that time, in the early 90s what projects were you working on when the early nineties I I was then getting into where I was research fellow and director and so also had the you know sitting on management meetings which by the way take a lot of time and so I was kind of getting out of the end of independent project thing even though I was, on the business team for beta and I was interfacing a lot of Technology like a National Labs and this type of thing, is that a fair characterization of what your activities have been and my activities in the 90s I was going to finish okay for the midnight in the mid-90s what is the status of things as far as what you're doing when the mid-90s I've continued to essentially be in charge of the emerging technologies that we come in and look at it, so take a look at exhibit to I'm going to place before you sorry is it a 2 is update stamps 1000 2774 24 through 447 and ask you to take a look at that and I'll direct your attention to a couple pages of it, dr. Lily I place before you watch for marked as exhibit number two really to and I will make the assumption that you have never seen this document before is that fair to say and we call this thing that's talking it isn't a document that was apparently presented to our D in New York in 1961 and, I would assume that since you weren't with the company it would be hard pressed to see the 1961 correct or any time since then for that matter I don't recall everything okay for the record object to counsels representation of testimony about whether it was presented to whom and where that's speaks for itself on the face of the documents Fair let's turn your attention if you would serve to page, page 74 3L you can look on the side here and right there that tells you what page 7 and I refer to the last four digits 743 oh you don't have any reason dr. Lilly to think that this is not a Philip Morris document that correct by looking at the cover page of this document, objection foundation in speculation, I mean reading the document it says Philip Morris incorporate if you look on page 74 30 The Heading says the cancer controversy and then there are some definitions do you see that yes looking at those definitions dr. Lily do you have any reason to disagree with any of the definitions on that page Jackson yeah, I can read them I miss her and based on your your years at Philip Morris in the R&D Department give any reason to disagree with the substance of the definitions that are presented on that page the one with actions when we let the witness read it okay let's do that, from reading it, I mean I couldn't tell you if they're correct I can recognize some words okay so let's take these definitions are the first one, is carcinoma that's it appears to be defined is that correct women are you saying does it appear to be the funds they appear to be defined, and you know ask him right Leah wrong yet does it appear to be defined that's the first ESO es a definition are you able to read the definition and have an opinion as to whether that's a correct definition of the carcinoma objection compound question have a personal opinion or is he have a what he considers to be an expert you can answer well I object to the extent this question which and I believe that does calls for an expert opinion, again the witness has not been proffered as an expert in this case I think it's highly improper that looks expert at the questions for this witness an additional lacks Foundation calls for speculation beyond the competence of the witness, this is beyond the competence well II would put a spin on the competence of what of your abilities to testify here today I certainly learned something because I didn't know the difference between carcinoma and sarcastic are sarcoma okay you know what of course indiginous, Jackson, without reading the definition sitting here today dr. Louise lives let's let's uh put the document to the side for a moment if I when I ask you as I am right now dr. Lilly do you know what a carcinogen is what is your answer to that question objection I think it calls for Testimony outside this Witnesses expertise well he studied how to reduce course in the gym so I would assume you know what they are objection if that's an attempt to characterize it, prior testimony for the Drury of jail from the character says count you know what excuse me the council's mischaracterization of acquire customers you know what a question do this way I know what I think it is, although I'm not sure it's what I think it is is what it says here okay and I think of it as a compound that applied in some amount can cause has a tumor or some kind of gray it says test animals here I didn't realize that, okay let's look at page 7 4 3 4, yes juicy the heading there that says partial list of compounds in cigarette smoke also identified as carcinogens yes, dr. movie looking at this list can you write that up fi any of these, compounds as compounds that were studied in any manner by Philip Morris in the R&D Department as far as you know objections to form in any manner, if you mean were they part of some chemistry of smoke and one of the Laboratories or this type of thing let's take the first one as an example the first one is arsenic correct yes it says arsenic okay what efforts were, conducted by Philip Morris to set to study, Arsenic and lack of foundation speculative assumes facts not in evidence it is I don't know that as for you you're aware is a fair to say Sir that there were you're not aware of any studies of arsenic in any manner I'm the optionally a warrior asked and answered are you aware of any efforts to reduce, arsenic in cigarette smoke by Philip Morris and objection, no I'm not I'd like to the interest of saving time but if Council wants me to do it I certainly will I want you to look at each one of these compounds that are listed on this page and tell me what efforts you were aware of to reduce or eliminate any of these compounds and when I say efforts I mean efforts at the Philip Morris research and, all of those facilities anywhere in the world, to reduce or eliminate in any way any of these compounds ejection Foundation improper form, also assumes facts not in evidence and ask the witness to assume that the document he's looking at is in fact correct true and accurate for which he has no Foundation but we're going to assume that it is for purposes question short and accurate I'd like to know what efforts Philip Morris has undertaken to reduce or eliminate any of the compounds listed on this page in any of its facilities and relaxed and object on the grounds of snow proper have, question you can is relation to my other objections you can answer, may I see a list of what looks to be poly aromatic hydrocarbons and I will say that ventilation and filtration that reduces tar in general would reduce these things was there a specific effort to reduce pahs undertaken by Philip Morris while you've been there there was research on pah is I think the research showed they were very non volatile compounds that are intimately involved with talk, are there other compounds on this page that you were aware of the default Mars has attempted to reduce or eliminate injection I think it's an improper question and Foundation renew my prior objections as well, for things in the gas phase like Benzene get reduced by ventilation also and you're looking at which compound that's on this looking at bins thing that's a gas face compound right benzo a pyrene whether that would I want I'm looking at that whole list of benzo a and been Zoe and been Josie okay that's poly aromatic hydrocarbons, and to Philip Morris while you were at the company, specifically undertake to reduce, pahs in the cigarette smoke I remember us developing techniques to measure these compounds, and this is even going back further maybe we tried to look at various splits like waxes like you know stems and so forth to see the delivery I believe the answer you know when least my, my memory says that these are compounds very non-volatile that are intimately tied up with tar so the general way of reducing would be to reduce tart which was done by filtration and ventilation, I don't call of any well I person would know of any specific way at least in my knowledge to do it, were you personally involved in any research to eliminate or reduce any of the compounds listed on that page section is to form, I was involved in research and understanding the global breakdown in pyrolysis and combustion and flood but not tied to any specific compound was anyone at felt Mars involved in any research tied to a specific compound in an effort to reduce or eliminates that compound objection Foundation speculation, I think we had the whole research programs involved in both pah has and tobacco-specific nitrosamines yes, are you still are still involved in programs that you just mentioned which were programs designed to reduce phh's and the work tobacco-specific nitrosamines actually sit here today church and Foundation, if you're talking about in Richmond the yes if you're talking about it I'm sorry in Richmond I know if you're talking about work still going on to understand those things you have p.m. Europe okay where is it be done in neuchÃ¢tel lightning does the there's a lot of the nitrosamine work now they're still doing it so far as I know they're still doing it to the extent they're, that couldn't tell you right now, where was I when were efforts in Richmond ceased with respect to reduction of TSS, direction is to Foundation, I think it had to be some time either shortly after before 1990, by the way there is the of course we talked way earlier about beta which is certainly a program that is a lot of technology to reduce almost everything here but Diamond took your question to be conventional cigarettes do you say almost everything you hear you mean an effort to reduce question engines and cigarettes objection argumentative lacks Foundation, please data refers to the document was no showing the witness has the foundation to agree or disagree with that statement can you be back my questions please, when you say almost everything here you mean an effort to reduce carcinogens in cigarettes, for the beta program wasn't designed to reduce carcinogens but it was designed to produce reduce or make some reduction of those compounds formed at high temperature and I'm sure not all of those would be carcinogens put somewhere carcinogens correct I'm sure some of them are Carson and therefore therefore effort is being made to remove or reduce, carcinogens in tobacco smoke technology was developed excuse me for being a physicist to control when limit the temperature which tobacco was taken to low temperature, the result of that, was a reduction of high-temperature compounds certain high temperature compounds when combined, produce carcinogens is that correct objection last stop and this provides Foundation, are there lots of compounds when you have high temperature that Collide and produce many of the compounds on this list that's correct sir I think about it too many breaks, dr. Willy have you read any right while you are foot Morris have you received, any reports from Philip Morris Personnel that identified, compounds in cigarette smoke that were, labeled carcinogens, I'm sure I have, what what project or projects can you identify the boat wars that were specifically undertaken to reduce, carcinogens in tobacco smoke, I mean the the projects I've been familiar with since I've been there were that we had projects for years and Nitro some means, I remember projects involving polyaromatic hydrocarbons, and of course there have been lots of projects to reduced our to we've had projects to try to specifically filter gas phase components what was the importance of, trying to filter gas phase components what is it about gas phase components that makes it necessary try to filter them section is to form a big well I think number one gas phase from cigarettes are is pretty obnoxious to smoke so there are subjective reasons, and we've done a lot of work on understanding charcoal as a filter we're there any health-related concerns at Philip Morris which were driving the company to try to filter gas phase components objection Foreman Foundation I don't think I ever heard that explicitly said but some of the compounds that on this list for instance, and Zayn is one of the things that charcoal dust along with ventilation reduce, off the record I need a cup of coffee filter it out that the videographer we back on we are, dr. Willy the court reporter is placed before you what is marked as a little exhibit number three it's not bait stamped but it is a document that I'd like you to take a look at specifically the first page two pages which is the executive summary yes, then if you could just, take a look through the executive summary, have to tie a border or well you could let me let me rewrite what it's all about right there you go, okay, doctor will you you'll see, Paige have you read this I read the first page you want to recycle okay sorry I didn't see the second time you want to read the SEC I thought you said the executive summary okay all right you're right on target, okay doctor will you will see a chart on the second and third page of this document that identifies certain smoke constituents and my question to you is could you point out to me and the members of the jury which if any smoke constituents, thought Mars has studied in particular that are on this chart let me just put it that I really I don't know what this document is where it came from but it would appear either to be, I don't know whether it's work product or what but I wonder whether it is subject to a document request issued by Philip Morris in this case and whether or not it's ever been produced before okay I'll answer that question for you not that it's actually relevant right now nor do we really do the take up our precious time deciding that but it has been produced 12 Mars and the fact is all I'm asking about is the chart and the constituents that are on that, can you you have it because we need has a chip so you know where it came from but he has, an old friend of yours well all I'm asking is was it produced it was beneath has / has this doctor has been produced a salt marsh was it produced as part of dr. Franz document has been produced far dr. Franz document requests and let me just say this I believe it I believe it has if it hasn't it certainly will be but I think that dr. firaoun has purchased this document along, many other pages of documents in connection with his recent deposition, and I think Vinny could confirm that if you can't it certainly should have been and will be produced well the moment point is this if this is if this is a document that is otherwise subject to the document request file by Philip Morris in this case and it is not yet been produced today then I would have ejected any questions on it and move to strike those questions if it turns out that this in fact has not been produced let's look at the chart and that's fair let's look, look at the chart which lists or ppears the list cigarette smoke constituents you see that chart there yes I do I'm going to eject to the reading of the record whatever you're about to do expressly or implicitly from a document which is not going to Fennekin let's assume that this document lists properly list constituents and cigarette smoke with that assumption	 could you please identify any studies that thought Wars has conducted with respect to any of these constituents objection is to form and Foundation	 can I include non conventional cigarettes sure	 acid aldehyde what kind of studies has felt more conducted that connects without that acid aldehyde	 we've measured and the beta cigarette compared to a industry reference cigarette with they had prior to the beta cigarette have felt Mars as far as you understand or know ever measured acetaldehyde sections to form ever measured it well he's just so they measured a debate on whether yeah they it's part of a suit compounds called out of the hides and certainly they've been measured before has any efforts been made by Philip Morris to	 juice acid out of hides in cigarette smoke section Foundation	 actually the aldehyde is reduced by ventilation	 was it worse is efforts at design is cigarettes with ventilation in part driven by a desire to reduce acid aldehydes	 what was Jeremiah desire to reduced our over what normal filters would do and so with the ventilation part was a boost to increase the filtration efficiency of the filters being used so in a drive to get the low tar cigarettes I mean that's why we needed ventilation there was no other way to get there where the conventional filters	 are there any other constituents that are listed on this chart that Philip Morris has studied well again I mean acid aldehyde Acro lien and formaldehyde which I think occurs on the next page are the aldehydes I was talking about okay	 so the and they not conventional cigarettes approach those very well	 Ben's thing is is approached Again by the by both ventilation and on conventional cigarettes	 and I think the series of bends those there are they are the poly aromatic hydrocarbons that certainly are approached very well if you lower the temperature of cigarettes whether it's a premier or beta	 chromium we spent millions of dollars developing an alloy free of chromium they've never been done before to keep chromium out of our beta cigarette that was not a connection with the beta cigarette the beta Prime talking about their we made sure that there was no chromium in the heating materials which is very unusual not to have any material without chromium	 okay the same with nickel	 I've just signed I is I think we mood reasonably well by cellulose acetate in the filter in the filter yes sir	 and for nulls at the end are quite Cyborg and cellulose acetate again all of these compounds are reduced in the non conventional cigarettes	 put that document inside of the wood	 dr. Lily the court reporter is places for you what has been marked as Lily exhibit 8 excuse me Lily exhibit number for bait stamped 10030 990 352	 99 149	 off the record for a minute let's take the wack	 dr. Lily I have placed before you this exhibit have you seen this document before sir I never recall saying this document now I will represent you sir that this was introduced at your deposition of the ABC case as exhibit 8 and car was asked a question I don't recall saying the whole dock that's because it probably came with fairly quickly and that thing is	 can we turn to page 34 and I'm looking at this look doctor I'm looking at this the PA designation to 10:34 64 1034 oh	 I'm sorry 64 103 for the PA bar code is what I'm referring to	 if you look almost all the way down the page on that document sir the fourth name for the top appears to be your name is that correct for the bottom yes you're listed as one of the Consultants to a smoking health program is that correct objection it speaks for itself	 I'm listed there	 do you recall serving as a consultant to the National Institutes of Health in connection with us smoking and health program status report which is what this document is labeled what we call being called a consultant but I recall going with compositing to one meeting and also your consultant for me yes	 I believe this is the time that the tobacco companies were working with dr. gorrie and they were meetings between the industry I was asked by Tom to go to one meeting which I did go to but what let's look on page 8 of the report and I see page 8 at the original page number of this report I know I'll put you back to different numbers now page eight	 they page in this document	 page 8 you'll see a chart on that page do you not called table one right yes I see that table one appears to be a list of major toxic agents in the gas phase of cigarette smoke do you see where I'm reading from the identification of that table yes	 if you could look on the chart to the left there there are lists a series of toxic agents and my question to you sir is could you identify any studies that Fillmore's undertook to reduce or eliminate any of these	 toxic agents injection to your characterization the document has been is stands unauthenticated this point he's never he says he's never seen it before so objection the basis the foundation has to the document and it's deformed	 I think my answer is as before some of the non conventional cigarettes we worked on redo have no side string and the mainstream gas phase is reduced considerably and certainly the aldehydes and	 nitrogen oxides carbon monoxide	 are the major ones that come to mind as I read the list	 did Philip Morris ever internally test any of these agents listen to this chart for levels of toxicity objections foundation	 no I don't know as a specific compound I know we test lots of smoke but I'm not sure it's a specific compound I just don't know	 let's turn to page 11 and I want to direct your attention to the last paragraph on that page specifically sort of the second-to-last sentence in that paragraph the last paragraph last paragraph on 11 and the specific	 okay actually the sentence before the second to last so the third floor West where it says the biological effects of the flavor additives or their combustion products and smoke are unknown do you see that sensor yes I do this document I think appears to have been completed in 1978 as far as you understand it	 that still true statement that the biological effects of flavor additives or they're busting products and smoke or unknown objection that assumes that it was untrue or that it was true when it's written there's no foundation for this document anything that's in it for your test you're questioning this witness hadn't laid a foundation for it and on that basis as stated by mr. nunnelee I move to strike your reading into the record from the document in 1978 sir were	 Optical effects of flavor additives in Smoke node for as you know protection Foundation I've never really been privy to flavor compounds in their cigarettes so I certainly don't know in 78	 in your career field Mars have you had any occasion to work with cigarette additives	 not really no what about it's in an indirect manner have you worked with cigarette added instructions to form they I mean I've I certainly know some of the things that go in cigarettes like chocolate and glycerin and that type of thing I've never really sat down and looked at a brand this the ratites I saw in my newspaper the 599 list when I got back from Japan	 I think it was a list maybe it was the industry that they're reported as being put the cigarettes yes but you your testimony is you have not had occasion at Philip Morris to study additives for any reason other than putting some glucose on the backhoe instead and its mechanical properties know	 you haven't had any occasion Fillmore's to study the health impact of inhalation of cigarette additives correct dr. Lily personally pretty good night are you aware of any studies that felt Mars with respect to the Innovation impact of cigarette additives on human health	 hang Only By Hearing people talk that we	 and again this is second or third hand	 we've employed a set of toxicologists and look at the at our flavor systems over the years who headed up that effort Foundation	 not really sure who headed it up maybe it was dr. Oz e maybe it was dr. Charles I mean they were both involved in that area will you ever get attendance at a meeting where results of	 toxicology studies	 of Philip Morris flavor systems were reported	 not a Philip moist flavor systems I've heard reports of chemistry and toxicology on some of our non conventional products that I've been working on	 but not on your conventional cigarettes no sir no sir	 what have been the results of the toxicology reports that you've been that you've received on the data projects well number one I've never received them in my hand I've heard reports	 what what it what have you heard I've been a series of chemistry and I think we talked about that earlier showing in general large reductions over a standard reference cigarette	 they be named studies	 which again showed large reductions over a reference cigarette and they've been	 like I don't think I've seen any of them is results on information studies which largely have a lot of pathology so I really haven't haven't seen those Earth and heard they look okay and that's you know by one of the people who were running that program who's that Rick some Mana	 dr. Lily did Philip Morris ever study the smoke aerosol as a function of particle size yes why was such study undertaken Chucky Foundation	 I think of a study the several times I mean we had work early because there was a lot of trying to understand the physics and chemistry of forming the smoke are so and it's very key if you're going to design filters to know what the size distribution is	 there was also some interest in in the	 chemistry as a function of the size	 because that would allow you if it really is is not uniform across the size to design filters that would take a certain size fraction out then they were also studies where we were trying to	 see how much uncondensed vapor and and how that was mixed in with the are smoke aerosol particles that we took another look at the size generation and the kinetics are doing so so over the years there's been a number of what I would consider basic research studies and in that type of thing does the particle size of the cigarette smoke make any difference in the ability of the smoker to inhale the smoke	 Foundation	 I'm sure it does but I'm not exactly sure	 what those fractions are	 this is a pH level of the smoke make any difference in the ability to Smoker to inhale the smoke objection Forum Foundation calls for opinion testimony outside this witness has expertise in that you know whether Philip Morris ever study that question	 which question	 I don't hear the witness the witness tells me that he's understand the question objection to the form it's a vacant answer stamp I think certainly	 Philip Morris has looked at pH and we have a method for pH I think we could argue long and hard what PH means and I won't do that	 there certainly has been studies adding basis to cigarettes and and smoking those over the years I think largely may be centered in some of the smoker psychology groups	 hear about that last answer	 the answer was I think certainly Philip Morris has looked at pH and we have a method for the age I think we could argue that long and hard what PH means and I won't do that there certainly has been studies adding basis to cigarettes and and smoking those over the years I think largely may be centered in some of those smokers I'm sorry smokers	 G groups what do you mean studies adding basis to cigarettes I'm not sure I understand that	 objection to form	 all right you can barely tobacco tends to be more basic than flue-cured or Orion although it's not they still on the acid side and it's because it's below pH 7 there have been studies over the years	 for one could add ammonia compounds or bases like calcium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide to tobacco	 what what's the impact of adding ammonia to Tobacco has that been studied by Philip Morris injection you got to give me more than that have you studied the relationship between different levels of ammonia and its relationship to	 smoker satisfaction rejection use a pronoun vae the pronoun you and that question it's fake	 is that pathetic by Fort Myers Jackson Foundation	 well I mean number one Burley tobacco has a lot of soluble ammonia	 and it's very difficult to smoke in fact almost impossible to smoke by itself	 some of our Recons reconstitute tobacco have ammonia compounds	 it was before we did supercritical adding potassium hydroxide to the backhoe and steam stripping was one of the ways we remove nicotine early on and left a lot of soluble ammonia	 I think in general things that have lots of that are very very hard to smoke I mean barely is I mean in my mind impossible to smoke by itself and what is needed to treat Burly to make it palatable smoke section Foundation	 well I think in general either you mix it with some other things like Pluto cured and Oriental which by the way are characterized by high sugars are you put some sugar on it	 two	 the level pH make any difference in the amount of nicotine that's available in the gas phase the level of pH where the level of pH in tobacco smoke make any difference in the amount of nicotine that's available in the gas phase detection by the level of pH in tobacco smoke	 again a proper objection would be objection vague instead of an editorializing of the question but well how about this objection nonsensical	 you can	 not going to tell you how to make them directions	 if you have a if you have a solution of nicotine here the pH of the solution determines	 how much of the of the molecule is in soft former how much is in the free molecule form and there will be some vapor pressure above that likewise if you're in tobacco and their pH becomes a little more tricky to Define because you don't have much water so you're defining pH in the system where there's not much water	 and I frankly don't know what that means but I'll continue on you still going to have some vapor pressure of nicotine above that	 and it's going to be less than you would have if it was a pure solution now that's limited by fact you can't go above the vapor pressure of the system are begins to rain nicotine you got a relative humidity thing there if you have tobacco are saw particles that are basically on the acid side meaning below 7	 it's my at least opinion that even though they're in a hundred percent atmosphere of ammonia and less the ammonia actually goes into the particle interacts you going to have a very limited amount of vapor pressure of nicotine above that particle but you are will always have something you will always have some	 the free nicotine molecule diffuses a heck of a lot more rapidly than than they forgot a big saw tight onto it	 and so basically if you come along and you sweep that nicotine that's in equilibrium with it away	 if you got more of the free molecule it'll recharge it sits it wants to always recharge so that same value and they're do it quicker because it will diffuse quicker	 and that will be a measure of how much you've got in free and salt form that's a very tricky problems it actually do in detail in my mind and doing real time which is I think is very difficult Corporal do	 answer	 very tricky problem well-to-do base where I was getting at to to do it in real time meaning that you don't disturb the system because you don't want the measurement to give you a different system I think it's very difficult to dicks and it's a complex problem to really understand	 thirteen billion aerosol particles around	 free of water that and so how do you define pH we'd like to take an afternoon break and just so there's no confusion I'm likely to have 15 minutes of testimony cross-examination at the end but I want to get on the record and the witness needs to leave it about 5:00 so I need to have have it wrapped up at about 4:45	 because I had my own questions this prepositions been cross medicine Washington I haven't even begun a hand box of exhibits over there so the deposition won't conclude today well I mean our position is it was noticed for a day the witness has been here you had a chance to work out your co-counsel completely different and if you look at the deposition notice it doesn't limit it to a day I haven't asked one question	 so you're taking the position that I can't ask any questions and cross taking the position of the deposition will conclude today you said you have 15 minutes at the conclusion of testimony the testimony will not from dr. Lily will not conclude today is my efficient well then I think that would take position if that's the case then this deposition can't be used at all until it's concluded and you know you can work that out with your well that's exactly right and then I want to put you on notice that that's	 position you're not going to have the hold this open Forum you know until you decided at convenience to come back and take it up I don't know well maybe we'll look into that can you look into it now so I'll now sure all that according to Porter you have a court reporter available tomorrow but I'm sure if you prefer I didn't notice videotaped deposition okay so you don't want a videographer tomorrow you know	 its position of the plaintiffs and barns that this deposition has been noticed day to day until completed and I have no problem at all giving you as much time as you need to cross this witness but I'm not necessarily going to cut my examination off at 4:30 see the here's the bottom line John if you're not finished at 4:45 in the deposition I'll take the position that the deposition	 want a chance to question for 45 and I'm not going to I'm not going to cut my examination off because you want a question I'm willing to come back here tomorrow morning and allow you to question him for four hours if that's what you need to do but you know you're giving me an arbitrary deadline what else what you told me at the start of the deposition we're going to need all day I'll talk to the witness maybe we'll just stay the night and finish I don't have really I want you to	 that much well more than it might be a little it might be a little it may be a little longer than 445 but it certainly I'm certainly happy to do to do that too to try to accommodate you and me and get this over one day because I think we could do that with a little more time I really do so and as far as the state of Washington is concerned I have no problem with you cross-examining for 15 minutes that's not my point the deposition as far as the state of Washington is concerned however will not conclude today	 you want me to negotiate with mr. Butler and his firm to continue it	 that's fine but I understood you to say this morning you're representing Philip Morris in the state of Washington also and that's why I directed the comic to you because that will not be the conclusion of the deposition for the state of Washington we will need to talk talk off the Record because I don't know that I'm prepared to have a deposition just stay open indefinitely so we may need to include you can tell me what you did Envision that that we would conclude	 I mean you know these crossed over the center done for you guys convenience I mean it's not fair chip to expect because I'm taking all day that Jennifer doesn't have a chance to question him and that's just not right what I want to get involved in that I'd rather comes with remarks about to go and challenge is not the mirror for the convenience of go more stun for a variety of reasons we don't need	 discussing here we don't let's go off the Record well okay with you chick alright we are back on the record okay I've got I'd like to put something on the record of dispute has arisen over the scope of the deposition and the entitlement of the state of Washington to answer questions Beyond Today and task pregnant not answer to ask questions to ask you said answer	 excuse me there are dispute has arisen over the entitlement of the state of Washington to I don't want you to cut me off that's interesting alright dispute has arisen about the State of Washington's entitlement to ask questions both today and Beyond Today of this witness dr. Lily dr. Lily's deposition has been noted in the State of Washington's case it is the noted pursuant to compulsory cross noticing requirement imposed by the court in Washington	 it was the defendants is a group including Philip Morris will requested the crossroad of chrome and that is why we are here today mr. Nutley is taken the position that this Council has taken the position that the deposition will close today we disagree with that frankly I believe that my presence here today should be paid for by Philip Morris since I haven't been able to ask a question we are not required under our cross noticing	 in order to coordinate with co-counsel from any state we all had different cases and we do so we will continue this deposition and it will be reconvene shortly as I said I could have obviated the need for that but I guess you wanted to be on the record not talk with my colleague from Washington and he told me that he thought the appropriate thing to do was to reserve this for a later time we had to make dr. Lily available	 we'd be happy to do so that's what I was going to tell you if beginning before you took up some time on the record given that we're running short so I guess we're in agreement ready to resume yes sir part where she said that Philip Martian paper expensive today certainly is not Philip Morris's film are considering that the cause for the fact that you were not able asking the questions today back on stop the lily	 the are you familiar with the are L process at fault morphs or LBD reconstituted leak process objection Foundation I'm familiar with the you know the general concept of the process yes sir	 dr. Lily in the are L process is potassium nitrate removed for the water solubles	 potassium nitrate is taken out at the time all the solubles are washed out and something is called strongly extracted liquor as SEL	 I'm sorry I'm sorry and then there is a process called crystallization in which that material is pumped into a tank where they Refrigeration coils that cool the material and potassium nitrate crystallizes out not entirely obviously but it crystallizes out so that it is reduced	 terrible	 can you just give me the last sentence of those in please	 and then there is a way in which that material is pumped into a tank where they're all Refrigeration coils that cooled material and potassium nitrate crystallizes out not entirely obviously but it crystallizes out so that it is reduced considerably	 Boris makes a concerted effort do they not to remove significantly potassium nitrate	 yeah I mean to the extent that crystallization will remove it that's correct so why why why does Phillip Morris reduce considerably potassium nitrate has to Foundation	 potassium nitrate is considered I think by most people in the business to be a source of nitric oxide in oh	 and that's a precursor to the atrocity formation Jackson Foundation no I think it's largely something delivered in the gas phase that is just like Co it's a it's a gas that certainly is an irritant best and is there also something that is dangerous to human health	 Jackson Foundation I think you know is your only something that in large enough quantities is certainly in Jewish to healthiest is potassium nitrate are a carcinogen	 section Foundation	 not to my knowledge none	 is nitrogen oxide of course indigent	 I don't know the answer to that	 is it true dr. lily that if nitrates are reduced in smoke that	 the	 amount of certain other harmful substances is increase such as benzopyrene rejection is to form Foundation	 I don't know the answer to that	 how much of the potassium they tree is removed and a percentage on a percentage basis in the are L process the RL process Foundation	 I don't think I have an exact number	 I may have heard one time I just don't have an exact number would you say that is it fair to say 175 percent is removed section just to form a nation I just I just don't know	 potassium nitrate is present in the Raw tobacco that Philip Morris purchases is that correct	 to my knowledge it's part part of what the farmers use and their nitrate fertilizer they put on the fields	 do you know whether there are any other constituents that are present in the Raw tobacco that have been reported in the literature to be	 known as a carcinogen sections to form and Foundation	 I think anytime you talk about metals	 I think you'd have to find them coming in and they're all tobacco why are they removed in any manufacturing process of Philip Morris is engaged think so	 what other constituents of tobacco or remove in the URL process section Foundation	 I'm basically Arielle process as I understand it is a extract	 t' take the Fiber One way to a paper machine	 take the extracted liquor crystallized it and I'm not sure what comes out during the crystallization I'm sure it's just not pure potassium nitrate concentrated with an evaporator because you've added water to it and take that material and put it back on the fiber and make essentially a paper tobacco paper out of it	 but are there other constituents of tobacco that are removed in the are removed from the water solubles during the RL process other than potassium nitrate section Foundation by Design you're talking about correct I mean you tend to lose size eyeballs which contain lots of things including nicotine and you tend to lose things that are volatile in the	 operators I don't remember everything and the exact list of how much remove but certainly they have to be losses there	 alkaloids are not intentionally removed from the water solubles correct	 to my knowledge that's correct sir why are alkaloids not removed from the water solubles as potassium nitrate is the foundation	 well I think that you've got a	 a solution made up of certainly hundreds of compounds potassium nitrate is pretty unusual in that you can cool the system and basically precipitated as a solid some of the things that are water soluble	 you would have to go to a lot more technology to remove those explicitly	 wood	 strike that	 is Phillip Morris presently capable	 in terms of the technology to remove alkaloids from the water soluble in the are L process actually Foundation	 give me my personal opinion it would be awfully difficult to do	 why is that	 because you've got huge movie hundreds of millions of gallons of rather dilute Solutions	 and if you want to move one thing specifically in that way I'm not exactly how we how if I were given the job how I would go about it I might tend to do like we did with Dean Nick we move it from the tobacco before doing anything through a supercritical extraction process and which was certainly one that we understood the technology	 so if one wanted to produce an RL product that was nicotine-free it certainly could do so correct section Foundation	 you would have to take tobacco stems which basically is what makes up Arielle	 and you would have to set up a huge plant to Super critically produce those	 or maybe throw all the side tables away I mean it's not clear in my mind exactly what I would do you know to do that in an effective manner well certainly Philip Morris at one point at its facilities here in Richmond did remove essentially all the nicotine from tobacco correct	 yes so therefore it's possible that it could have done that in the process of making reconstituted leaf tobacco correct rejection was characterized as a testimony like Foundation	 well I mean my statement on that would be we built a plant to the neck of the eyes hard word to say 20 million pounds of tobacco I believe the amount of REO we turn out as 150 million pounds so one has a scale problem certainly	 have you talked about is it theoretically possible I mean I couldn't disagree with that is it possible practically on the scale that you're asking I'd have to think about that one	 just nicotine as far as you understand contribute to the taste characteristics of tobacco	 Direction Foundation	 I think so haven't smoked some of the cigarettes with and without nicotine I would say at least from me speaking I say yes are you have any	 strike that other than from your personal experience are you aware of any research that Philip Morris conducted that would support your personal experience that nicotine contributes to taste characteristics of tobacco	 directions to form I'm not intimately involved but there has been some research studies I think the one that comes to mind is some work being done at Duke	 which is explicitly I think trying to at least from a research standpoint talk about the taste of nicotine	 there may have been others by the way	 just Diggity contribute to the flavor characteristics of tobacco production asked and answered do you distinguish between taste and flavor I personally call them the same but that's that's my how I personally feel about smoking cigarettes doesn't nicotine you have undesirable Health consequences exception Foundation	 well II think it's an unusual molecule it has I mean from what I've read has both positive and negative health effects meaning - meaning high heart rate and and maybe some blood flow characteristics that are	 what's the word through maybe blood vessels that have shrunk in size so it was as an adverse impact on the cardiovascular system right section Foundation I've read articles to that effect yes have you read any internal studies or articles or memos and felt Mars Rd that would indicate that's the that's	 that's Philip Morris's view you included in your list an article I don't know what an internal article is any writings that have come out of Philip Morris in the form of memos that would indicate that nicotine has - seen sfx I'm sorry - cardiovascular effects I mean I have	 ready and explicit I've seen articles passed around from the peer-reviewed literature I'm I'm just you know one way or the other I don't know whether those have been out I mean I've seen peer review literature articles passed around	 were you involved at all in the nicotine analog programming Philip Morris sections to form an X there that we will wear that at one time there was a nicotine analog program at Philip Morris	 I became aware of it	 can't remember the exact date I think I became aware of it after it was essentially over yes	 did Philip Morris ever produce a commercially acceptable nicotine analog section Foundation	 and form I really don't I I wasn't really close enough to it than that	 or TSN a is formed by the interaction of nitrates of nicotine in or nicotine are TSA is formed by the interaction of nitrates of nicotine in newer the continues section Foundation believe it may call for well I mean I don't know the chemistry basically I mean they're formed by Night reciting	 some of the secondary alkaloids in tobacco for that nitrogen comes from I don't know it's alkaloids were removed along with nitrates during the production or manufacturer of cigarettes isn't it fair to say that the threat of carcinogens would be greatly eliminated rejection is to form argumentative and Foundation	 he removed all the alkaloids if you were to remove all the alkaloids and remove the significant portion of nitrates that you do remove right now the RL process isn't it fair to say that	 carcinogens would be greatly eliminated carcinogens you talking about nitrosamine so I try some sorry I trust me it's section form Foundation	 I certainly think they would probably be reduced where they would be eliminate I mean there are lots of proteins that also are nitrogen-containing of course how are tobacco-specific nitrosamines formed	 Jackson asked and answered	 I mean I don't know I mean the best I can do is tell you that some things like nor nicotine or night recited mean they get in the way of an nh-2 group where that I mean I just don't know there are lots of people who know who I'm sure a lot more than I do and I thought that with respect to the elk	 who in your mind would know a lot more about that than you	 I think action called Susan dr. Lily Jackson calls for speculation	 I mean he that I know I mean picking a chemist I think dr. Ted Sanders would know I think dr. Robin Kendra would know I think they would both know many times what I wouldn't know about the subject okay	 what back to the RL process what chemicals are added to the water solubles section Foundation	 as I understand it the stems come in and are extracted and so the side was come out and go through the process	 and they're concentrated back and then there are some flavor systems that I don't know all the the components of that are added there are two that I'm familiar with one something that's that we use	 that's called 150 B is the nearest thing I can come what may be its REO be now	 and then there's a set that are more compatible with flue-cured tobacco that are added so there are two two Orioles that come out is it AA diammonium phosphate added to the water soluble	 okay thanks no I'll process the URL process objection Foundation as I understand that the flavor system the called the b or the 150 be Oriole be this contains some diammonium phosphate has Diamond has demonium phosphate I've been tested at Philip Morris in terms of test for safe inhalation objection for man	 Foundation I don't know I certainly the Orioles have been tested I don't know whether that compounds been broken down and tested for say is propylene glycol added to the water soluble and the RL process traction Foundation	 to my knowledge there to so-called humectants added one is glycerin and one is propylene glycol	 I have there been inhalation test conducted Philip Mars with respect to those two chemicals I know there's been test and lots of tests on glycerin I'm less knowledgeable about what may have been done on propylene glycol who do you think it's a company dr. Lilly would know whether tests	 have been conducted with respect to inhalation of chemicals that are added to water soluble has traction splint it would burn Harold barley know that do you think Jackson speculation I don't think Harold would know I think Harold is a chemical engineer who worries about processes we have to be someone who is in the area of Science and Technology I mean I Richard karch Menorah Rick's Alana	 Sharia attitude water solubles	 in the process the RL process objection Foundation to my knowledge Yuri is one of the components and I think it would have to be to the What's called the rlb flavor system	 these ammonia or aqueous ammonia added to the water solubles in the are L process Direction compound and Foundation	 I want unless you're a f	 well I just couldn't answer that really ineffective what	 in the are L prostrate that as a general matter doctor Lily do you know when nicotine in cigarettes is measured by Philip Morris	 direct at what state let me let me rephrase it at what stage in the manufacturing process and that to me includes this time the tobacco is purchased to the time that it's shipped to a wholesaler is nicotine measured I mean the only thing I'm familiar with and I'll give you what I know on it	 like tobacco as it's gone through the stem re and get shaken to get all the stem out	 I mean we have something there's a tobacco lot analysis were some things are measured meaning things like alkaloids and sugars and that's it the I'm sorry is that the time at the stem re after purchase that would be after purchase before you going to put the tobacco away and then the other time I is when the product testing lab will test	 individual cigarettes and in general give an alkaloid number for the filler	 which is at that point to cigarettes are made	 so you're saying there's two at two different stages alkaloids are measured my knowledge and including the level of nicotine Corral I always see it as percent alkaloids	 but when I see percent alkaloids I know at least 95 percent of its negative	 don't different types of tobacco have different alkaloid levels or I think most certainly or different types of tobacco processed after purchase look strike that aren't different types of tobacco processed and stored separately section form and Foundation yeah I think they're I mean there's a multitude of grades of Dubai	 co-created by the agriculture department and by the company	 and coming out of the stem re these are processed and put into these so-called hogsheads big wooden things and put into storage and the put in there by grade and and a lot of that depends on where they were bought with it was Florida Georgia and North Carolina and so forth now when they're putting the hogsheads there's no tar measurement is there	 no I put in there is just kind of 2x2 squares of tobacco because you don't measure tard till after the cigarette has been manufactured correct to my knowledge that's true that you can't measure tour until I let you burn it after its manufacturing right but you can measure alkyl alkaloid percentages certainly before the tobacco is manufactured right objection I don't know what you mean about	 before tobacco is manufactured before the cigarette is manufactured sorry you're entirely correct well you can certainly measure percent alkaloids and tobacco since we at any time	 but I need to go off the Record please take the Undertaker
