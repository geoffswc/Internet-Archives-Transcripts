we are going back on record at 10:18 a.m. the start of take number two in the deposition of Richard Jupe, okay so I was asking about the brand so Marlboro gold does that have more smoke on the machine than Marlboro silver, yes and Marlboro gold has less Smoke on the machine and Marlboro Red yes is there a Marlboro White, no well I mean there's no where anyone could come to rank these and see how much smoke comes out of them right that is correct and you were told by the government you can't call them lights anymore right that is part of the oversight of the FDA that is correct, you know what when what went into making that decision to form but you can't call them lights anymore, the it was part of the statute well I know but but there's been a lot of scientific work about these Light cigarettes do you know why the the conclusion in the scientific and public health communities was made that you can't call them lights get the form again the reason we were asked to think about the pack something no question about it as part of the statute that's the drive in fact I suddenly no lights if you will load saw a, summon study by the public health and you've got monograph 13 flashing in front of me right now so I think you know there were some findings in there that light cigarettes the authors stated maybe not delivering less smoke well alright I'll talk about monograph 13 little bit I just was curious if you knew why you were told stop calling them like can I can I ask you something can I switch this off because he keeps flickering yeah, okay thank you good distracted we didn't mean to do it no no no it's all wrinkled okay all right so do you know in general why the Public Health Community didn't want you to call them lights objective form I think you suddenly we just discussed the monograph 13 and there was some, findings from the authors and that the suggested certain things but exactly why you know I drive it back to the statute that was requirement why we took it out of the price of the product, well okay let's let me start then you know you you keep up with the current scientific literature I'm sure right cigarettes and smoking and disease right I certainly try yes and and the 2010 Surgeon General report that's like the latest and greatest Surgeon General report right objective form it's the latest surgeon general's report and it's got a whole chapter on Nick, in addiction correct it does have a chapter on nicotine addiction now would it help you if I'm going to ask you questions about it to have have a you have your own copy of it Andy not handy you've got copies of it I'm sure right yes so would it help if I showed you electronically section is going to ask you about prefer that yes okay let me find it for a second, it's, see I know, get it right, GE 00 9600, now that's chapter 2 sorry, let's do we're just trying this for the first time all right hang on one second, let's try, SG 043 7:00, page 105, turn this a little bit yeah yeah make yourself comfortable when actual screen sorry they should be the same in but it's the actual document page number and that's not it, no that's not it all right can we can you see the page that you want to use you want to use PD let's go off the record for a second going off record at 10:23 a.m., going back on record at 10:24 am, okay mr. Jude you we've talked about, the things just in general we've talked about that strike that I asked you whether Philip Morris had tried to make a non-addictive cigarette and I'm going to we're going to talk about that for a little while just to give you the context let's I want you to examine for you to refresh your recollection page 105 in the surgeon general's 2010 most recent report, which is a which begins a chapter on nicotine addiction and your in general familiar with this chapter and with this report correct unfamiliar with reading the surgeon general's report what you have in front of me I can tell you what page it is, all right well it's page 105 if that helps you okay so let me ask you if you agree or disagree with what the Surgeon General says on page 105 about nicotine addiction says nicotine addiction is the fundamental reason that individuals persist in using tobacco products and this persistent tobacco use contributes to many diseases described in this report did I read it right you read that correctly, all right so do you agree or disagree with that statement Jeff deployment that suddenly feel that people are addicted some people are addicted to cigarettes and some of those people are not addicted to nicotine dependent upon nicotine and so yes I mean we agree that smoking is addictive and some of those smokers are addicted to nicotine well I but the statement really says more than that doesn't it says, and addiction is the fundamental reason that individuals persist in using tobacco products that's the first Clause of that sentence and that's what it says it says the fundamental reason it doesn't say that some people are addicted and all that it says the fundamental reason right that's what it says so does does that is that something Philip Morris agrees with or or Philip Morris fighting that objective form again I'm certainly not somebody who studied addiction I'm going to make that point very clear I know we, the earlier today and certainly we do agree that some people are addicted to smoking okay so is it the fundamental reason I guess we would probably disagree with that you disagree did you say disagree with the D I said disagree so Philip Morris now disagrees with the 2010 Surgeon General of the United States on nicotine addiction ejecta form clearly I said I disagree, well you taken a position it's different from what the company is a whole beliefs again I prefaced my own somebody saying I'm not the person who studies addiction I am not an addiction expert I certainly told you what I what I know when when I believe right there are people who smoked cigarettes unquestionably or addicted and some of those are addicted to nicotine well I'm not I appreciate that I'm talking about this statement made by the surgeon, that nicotine addiction is the fundamental reason that people persist in using tobacco products not that some people may smoke for one reason or another now with that clarification of my question do you still disagree with it objective for me I'm not sure I understand it clarification well I just tried to clarify by saying that you you you will never mind let me go back to this you're saying you are not an expert in addiction that's correct so are there any, experts at Philip Morris an addiction I think there are people more skilled who study this area than I do who would that be again I would say these are people within a health science research group who you've got are you asking me who was in names well names would be a start I would say people like dr. Lewis who heads that group okay can you give me his full name so I can send out a subpoena to him if necessary to she, it's a she and Aunt Jane Louis all right now Beyond who is it who is it in that group who works on that dr. Lewis I would have to consult with her okay fair enough so dr. Jane Lewis is an expert in addiction according to you in working in Philip Morris today right I said ho group would be the group that works on this and I don't know who, she would say is that quote unquote exponent, well her group is called what health science research so someone in the health science research you think is an expert on addiction much more so than I am yes well I mean is there someone I mean look you're there as I understood it correct me if I'm wrong trying to design cigarettes right yes and you would tell the world that Philip Morris is trying to design safer cigarettes right then, form but now you're saying no I just want understand your question I think going to can I ask you to stay that question again I'll read it back I'll be telling people we design safest cigarettes now you're telling people you're trying to design safer okay thank you for clarity question because that's what your testimony is all about right that's what we what we've been trying to do is reduce the risk of smoking there's no questions all right and yet in all this design, efforts you're saying you know you're not an expert in addiction true with that I am not an expert in addiction so you must have gotten some scientific help in Addiction in trying to design your cigarettes right object to form, or not I'm not sure I understand your question today if you're an expert in addiction then do you get scientific help on the diction question so it goes into the design of the cigarettes we don't design addiction into a cigarettes as I stated earlier today I think cigarettes are inherently addicted there's nothing we designed into the cigarettes for addictiveness but do you do you understand that, shouldn't causes people to smoke cigarettes in different ways than machines objective form I suddenly realized nobody smokes I believe a cigarette in a way on every single occasion like a machine that's been well known well publicized I'm not sure I know that it's because of addiction that they smoke their cigarettes differently than a machine well who would know that Philip Morris objective form, wouldn't know what the addiction to rephrase your question that addiction drives how people smoke cigarettes sure then I would have to consult with dr. Lewis and they dr. Lewis has never given you a memorandum on that okay before I don't think I've ever heard the question quite phrase like that I mean we suddenly realized that people smoke cigarettes differently now is it because of the fact that they're addicted that they smoke cigarettes differently, no one's ever thought of that Philip Morris I said I've no I said I've never excuse me I'm sorry if you just give me just a second before you answer so that I can object that's fine that's what we're talking over each other okay apologize fine doing good, I've never seen it written like that all right I want to get this straight so you've never seen any Communications if Philip Morris explaining, how or even whether addiction drives people to smoke in different ways including ways that can harm their health objective or not that's a different question right because your initial question was certainly how it smokes it differently than a machine okay now people smoke cigarettes differently I do myself within a day so what's driving how people smoke the cigarettes it's going to depend on the person, it's going to do what depend upon the individual who smoke him so you're saying that there has been no scientific work to your knowledge to your knowledge about how addiction defeats the design of cigarettes to produce low talk object to form, I don't know of any work all right fine we'll get to that but let's go back to the surgeon general's report first and be clear about the whole thing it says nicotine addiction is the fundamental reason that individuals persist in using tobacco products and this persistent tobacco use contributes to many diseases described in this report now it do you can you putting that whole sentence together is there any part that you can agree with subject for me, just to be clear is there any parts I can agree with is that you said thank you I didn't hear you properly I certainly believe that cigarettes are addictive and people smokes tobacco products and I do understand that the longer people smoke with the higher the probability of getting disease so does it contribute to some people I don't know the answer that question let me go back to the first Clause that you did that, that you disagreed with nicotine addiction is the fundamental reason that individuals persist in using tobacco products and you said you disagree with the Surgeon General statement on that correct I said I don't believe then yes because and as the Surgeon General says later in the report you know not all smoke has become dependent on nicotine not all smoke as a dependent on nicotine and that's the surgeon general's works and so I would say that people smoke for different reasons, whether the there's addiction whether it's addiction to nicotine whether they enjoy smoking whatever the reason is it's based on the individual and so the way I look at this is that if you're not addicted as if the smoker is not addicted or as the Surgeon General says not nicotine dependent then they are still exposed to smoke and that's something like I said earlier we prioritize our research on is reducing the exposure to smoke all right let's take it a step at a time you, you say nicotine addiction is you disagree with the Surgeon General that nicotine addiction is the fundamental reason that individuals persist in using tobacco products I just want to get that straight you haven't changed your testimony I certainly would say that it is an important reason why some people continue smoking I can't tell you because I'm not an expert that is the fundamental so all I'm really saying is I believe that those people who are nicotine addicted as the as a sentence begins, I would say that is the main reason or a primary reason why they would be smoking and important reasons is it the fundamental I can't answer that question because I'm not an expert all right so is it true then that you have you you want to amend your answer from saying that you disagreed with that statement to saying that you don't know whether it's true or not objective form I think I'd be better saying exactly what I just said I don't know it's the fundamental reason I'm not an expert I've not studied that area do I believe it's an important, reason for those people I would have to say yes but I just can't agree to fundamental I'm not an expert well you're saying you don't agree to this fundamental is that because you have received memoranda from these addiction experts at Philip Morris that's a Surgeon General was wrong, I've received no such memos well when the Surgeon General published in 2010, this piece including chapter 4 on nicotine addiction were their internal memoranda going around Philip Morris that analyze the science as stated by the Surgeon General, I don't know of memos I just don't recall memos and if they were there was something not addressed to me in regards to the Surgeon General 2010 report I mean there's no question that we have many people who review these reports and and tried to apply the loans at these reports as we've done since the first surgeon general's report so I just have not been party to such members on surgeongeneral 2010 you haven't been you think there might have been memos but, just didn't get to you I could check to form I hate to make an assumption but I'm just saying they may have been I'm not saying nothing existed I just don't know I was I just don't recall of anything any memo I received on this report so if the design of the cigarettes could have anything to do with with the importance of nicotine addiction as the Surgeon General talks about in 2010 you the cigarette designer have been totally left out of that Loop object to form, you know I'm just saying I didn't get any memos well did you have conversations with these people who know about addiction you know to say is this Surgeon General correct when they say when he or she says it's the fundamental reason that people are smoking I think it's it really is incumbent on us as a company to make sure we understand what the Surgeon General says you know we put a lot of effort into reading this we don't typically go back and, pick it apart and line-by-line sounds right wrong deny accept any of those criteria we simply don't do that we let science answer some of the questions and there's this was written back in 2010 or recently in 2010 but relied on data that was generated 10 years prior so science allows us to understand these positions even better, as it evolved you're saying now first you said the or you start to say that the 2010 report was written back in 2010 object to form that came out of your mouth it came out that way I didn't mean it to come out that way and but it was Suddenly It's Made to sound like a long time ago it was a very brief period of God John just a misstatement you're trying to paint the 2010 reporters old science subject to form why aren't you know Jack to form but it's getting argumentative, why did you say back in 2010 it was completely a misstatement of my behalf I've apologized I mean if this is this is the recent most recent compilation of what information was available to the author's when they put this report together and then you said oh all the research is 10 years old have you looked at the references object to form can that we need it's getting argumentative and you are mistaking what the witnesses said on the record so we're not going to, of the the record will reflect what he said he said 10 years the it was based on Research it's 10 years old didn't you say that some of the research I mean I'm looking at one line item here 1988 1990 for 1988 I'm not saying all the researchers old I don't remember all the citations all I'm saying is a position is not to go through and dissect the surgeon general's report is to understand it is to absorb it, I'm sorry I went off wrap it up position is to understand read it absorb it but it's not really one to sit and correct directly the surgeon general's report science allows knowledge to build in any one of these areas and yet you feel that that you disagree with what the Surgeon General statement of the science is in 2010 on nicotine addiction objective for no I don't think I said it like that, suddenly said I can't answer the first question you asked about a fundamental reason that's all I've said so far okay let's go after are going off record at 10:41 a.m., sorry I'm sure we're going back on record at 10:44 am, okay so, let me see if I can if I can summarize what we've talked about in terms of this statement by the Surgeon General and your understanding of it and and acceptance of it, do you, do you understand, what the Surgeon General is saying when when the Surgeon General says nicotine addiction is the fundamental reason that people persist in using tobacco products objective form, I think what the Surgeon General is saying is people smoke cigarettes, some people are addicted and that's why they continue to use tobacco products so you think that's what the Surgeon General said is people smoke cigarettes some people are addicted and that's why they continue to use you think that's the same thing as saying it's the fundamental reason objective Foreigner I think that's what I said, so you think do you think just based on your your review of scientific literature do you think the Surgeon General in writing the 2010 report was careless in their use of language objective form, I can't point to anything that I would characterize as catalyst so do you think they thought a lot about whether they would call it the fundamental reason as opposed to a reason or some people or any of those other characterization objective form I don't know what full process they went through well there's quite a bit of discussion in the citations which run which run tens and tens of pages of listed, laughter I don't remember the number of pages but there are numerous citations so I mean it would be easy to look at those articles and discussions and find where the Surgeon General got the statement it's the fundamental reason from right check the Forum I don't know if it's from a single document or the summary of what they read but I don't know what full process they went through I can only assume, they scoured the literature and did good scientific review of the literature well so is it important to Philip Morris whether addiction is the fundamental reason that people persist in using their products objective form again Phil Morris is where that people are addicted and some are addicted to nicotine I'm not sure I know how to answer that question any differently well I may ask it clearly if I can is is it important to Philip Morris that nicotine, diction is the fundamental reason that people persist in using your products, versus just one of the many reasons objective form I don't know how to answer that question I do not really understand it, well is it true that the persistent use of the product of the cigarette contributes to many diseases described in this report, it's suddenly the tobacco smoke and cigarette smoking, over time increases one's exposure to smoke and as one increases their exposure it's been well-documented they increase their likelihood of disease well as the Surgeon General says is it true that persistent use contributes to the many to many diseases described in this report objective form again if if you look at smokers and again from other studies more the smoke the longer period of smoke the higher the, probability of disease what is and then excuse me then I would say that is persistent as a way to describe that over time consistent whichever words you choose well persistent what is persistent mean to you exactly to keep using, to keep applying to keep doing something, so does Phillip Morris to your knowledge accept the proposition that nicotine addiction causes disease objective form I don't think we acknowledge that or record believe them, and you're the basis that Philip Morris would disagree that nicotine addiction causes disease is because of science that Nick that Philip Morris has done I think it's from not only the science of Philip Morris has done but many it's believe that there are many many many constituents in cigarette smoke and many of those have been identified for the role in diseases like lung cancer cardiovascular disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary, disease it is not nicotine per se that has been identified as potentially cause and lung cancer nicotine hasn't been identified as causing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease to my knowledge nicotine may play a role in cardiovascular disease but it really isn't the constituent that we are the Public Health Community of really said if you reduce this you may reduce the risk of smoking because of these disease endpoints so if nicotine is the fundamental reason, that people keep smoking or persisted using the product and the persistent use causes the disease then you're telling me you Philip Morris does not connect the the addiction the persisted the nicotine addiction to the disease object form I think persistent smoking consistent smoking smoking over time as I stated earlier, the more you smoke the longer you smoke again the science has shown the higher the probability of disease and exposure to these thousands of chemicals that we believe are causing these diseases, well so my question remains do you Nick you just told me that Philip Morris does not accept the proposition that nicotine addiction causes disease, I think I've answered the question a couple of times and by saying to my knowledge as if you look at what the public health and what we believe may be playing a role in diseases and when we say disease I'm talking about lung cancer I'm talking about chronic obstructive pulmonary disease I'm talking about cardiovascular disease I don't know of nicotine scientifically being associated with causation even associated with the mechanism of causes, diseases it's the other things in Smoke potential carcinogen carcinogens and other potential contributors do you understand what a chain of causation is Jesse more objective form I'm not sure I did, you know if if one thing causes another and that thing causes a third that that's considered a chain of causation between the first and the third object to form Foundation again I'm not sure I know them so that's something that you've never heard of in in all your years of scientific study you've never heard of a chain of causation from one thing to another object form I've certainly understand cause and effect I'm not sure I've studied that area enough to, that's really the only criteria why don't I just don't know that area I did say it was the only criteria I said did you understand that there could be a chain of causation starting at one place causing an intermediate thing and then that intermediate thing causing another and that's a chain of causation between the first and the third objective object to form you understand it I think I understand the fundamentals of that but again it's an area I've not studied, well you say it's an area that you haven't studied isn't isn't that just basic logic objective form argumentative and I would say that you know I've certainly read some logic and studied it a little bit in college but I wouldn't call myself an expert on logic and well rules need to apply before a chain of causation is a true event well let's say I'm trying to be very honest with you here I'm saying my knowledge in there is very much, the Lehman's level well let's just say that let's keep it on the Layman's level then and say that you you had your your pie prepared in your house and the plumber didn't screw the pipe together properly so the water leaked out on the floor and you walking by you fell on that water okay so you had the initial thing which is the plumber didn't put the pipe together right, you had as an intermediate thing you had the water on the floor and then you slipped on and fell now do you understand that there would be a chain of causation between the plumbers act and you fault, I understand that subject to form okay I think I'm following along in your example okay so you understand that in a legs a little chain of causation would exist from the plumber not putting the pipe together fact that there's water on the floor and the fact that you fell on abstract object to form I'm still following along your example, you don't have difficulty with that chain of causation do you objective form if indeed that's a chain of causation I'm following your sample and so an addiction causes use and use causes disease for some reason Philip Morris can understand that chain of causation objective form argumentative again it's not me sitting here kind of saying Hey look, not everybody's addicted it's not me saying that it's the surgeon general's also saying it right there although not all smokers become nicotine dependent and so if the smoker is not nicotine dependent I would still Venture that they can still get disease like lung cancer Etc from cigarettes even though there's no nicotine dependence well if they're if they are nicotine dependent then does their addiction contribute to their disease objective for, again I think when you look at disease you're looking at the constituents and smoke that have been associated with those diseases and so there are opportunities of when there's no nicotine dependence to get the disease well there's opportunities of slipping on the floor when there's no water right objective form obviously so just saying that there's no that there's opportunities to get it even if it's not there did not answer my question what if they are dependent, are you denying that their dependents contributes to their disease objective form I think what I'm saying is whether an individual is dependent or whether an individual is not dependent the smoking is going to contribute to disease, and does the addiction contribute to their smoking frequency objective one I think I just answered that and saying there are people who smoke who are addicted or people who smoke or addicted to nicotine there are people who smoke who are not classified as addicted I was I would say excuse me I would say the smokers in each three of those categories can contract these diseases by smoking cigarettes and people can slip on the floor with water, on it from the rain and with no water on it but my question is among people who are dependent are you denying can you answer my question first tell me if when I finish it if you can answer it yes or no fine or if you can't then tell me that among people are dependent does their dependents contribute to their disease objective form it's been asked and answered go ahead I'll try again I think of answered that question first can you answer yes or no, no I'm not going to answer it yes or no all right then I don't need an explanation, let's look at page 105 again the First full paragraph after the list that says tobacco addiction remains a substantial problem in the United States and we're of and worldwide you see that I see them now we're sure did General is of course talking about health and disease in this report correct I think in the, Port yes yes and when they're talking about a substantial problem they're talking about a public health problem correct in general yes yes alright does does Phillip Morris agree or disagree that nicotine addiction I'm sorry tobacco addiction remains a substantial public health problem in the United States and worldwide Phil Morris is always agreed that's quittin smoking as has been very difficult Philip Morris also, freeze it smoking is addictive and therefore if people have a hard time quitting then we would like to help them quit, I guess I wasn't clear again please let me answer it see if see if you can tell me whether you can answer yes or no then we'll get a yes or no and then you can explain or if you tell me you just can't answer that's fine but my question was very narrow I said does Phillip Morris agree or disagree that tobacco addiction is a substantial public health problem in the United States objective for me I think Philip Morris agrees that tobacco addiction is one of the issues we talked about, well and it's not as not as easy to say so yes or no answer but we would certainly agree that tobacco addiction is one of the issues associated with smoking we say that clearly on our website was it my question let me ask you the question again and ask whether you can answer yes or no that'll be my only question okay does Phillip Morris agree that tobacco addiction is a substantial public health problem in the United States today, object can you answer yes or no objective form I think I've answered that question so I cannot answer it yes or no okay, have you ever received any memoranda from the addiction specialists at Philip Morris if they exist, about whether tobacco addiction is a substantial public health problem in the United States no, does Phillip Morris agree or disagree that with this statement from the Surgeon General although not all smokers become nicotine dependent the prevalence of individuals diagnosed as nicotine dependent is higher than that for any other substance abuse disorder, objective form again this is an area I personally have not studied so I just don't know the answer to that question do you agree or disagree with this statement made on page 105 any efforts to reduce tobacco-related disease must take into account the addiction potential of a tobacco product, objective form you agree with that, and this is certainly what the Surgeon General is staging I've suddenly agree into that we must reduce tobacco-related disease and our approach has suddenly been to reduce ones exposure if the Surgeon General thinks that's an important aspect to it what this States and okay I'm not sure I understood okay first let's see if you can agree or disagree and I'll ask you a narrow statement so tell me yes or no if you, and or tell me you can't answer yes or no does Phillip Morris agree with the following statement made by the Surgeon General in 2010 any efforts to reduce tobacco-related disease must take into account the addiction potential of a tobacco product you agree or disagree objectively again I'm not an expert in this area so you can you agree or disagree or tell me you can't agree or disagree I guess I would have to, results that I can't agree nor disagree, and I take it you've received no memoranda from the experts at Philip Morris if they exist on nicotine addiction as to whether efforts that you have stated in your testimony that Philip Morris has done to reduce claims to have done to reduce tobacco-related disease, have taken into account the addiction potential of the product I know of No Such memo I've received, all right well then given the statements of the Surgeon General about the public health consequences of nicotine addiction and given the statement that any effort to reduce tobacco-related disease must take into account the addiction potential of a tobacco product given those statements, let me ask it this way shoot if you were to assume excuse me that the Surgeon General is correct in making those statements would that change, what Philip Morris, would that change the approach that Philip Morris uses	 to as you have testified try to reduce the risk of the product Vector form	 I think I understand your question it can do you mind if I try and play your question back to you oh can you ask it a different way what's your preference well I'd rather not not guess at what I said I think I got a question again yeah she can get it back I just said I didn't want to try	 would you play that thing always ask for that that's not a problem	 you know what the strike the question it's too it's too hard to understand it's wasting time let me go on just strike the question I'll do better all right	 it in view of what we've just read from the surgeon general's report	 let's ask in view of that	 why doesn't Philip Morris or why hasn't Philip Morris tried to design a non-addictive cigarette	 again if you take from the Surgeon General we suddenly have put a non-addictive sick if you take from the Surgeon General is me rephrase that if you take from the Surgeon General a non-addictive cigarette and you take from this chapter quote-unquote nicotine addiction we would certainly developed cigarettes with little and or no nicotine okay but our efforts of Philip Morris had been as I said earlier today focused on reducing the	 is from the other parts of the smoke the caused lung cancer and the other diseases I went through today	 well again unless you have you're telling me you have such limited resources regardless of what you're trying to do with the with the smoke constituents why don't you try to develop a non-addictive cigarette checked for me again as I said we have worked on a cigarette that has no nicotine if nicotine addiction is what the Surgeon General saying if that's what I'm interpreting your question as if a cigarette without nicotine according to the Surgeon General would not	 quote unquote addictive so if we developed such a cigarette yes	 well where is it the sell it we sold it and it didn't work well as far as a commercial adult smoker accepted product well what do you mean it didn't work people could light it and smoke it could they it didn't work thank you I'll clear that up for you it certainly worked as a function in cigarette just to the were very clear it was a cigarette that was put into Market since who tests in markets in the United States	 and the results of those markets indicated that that cigarette was not something people were willing to put their money on the table and by therefore it was withdrawn from the market	 so you're saying wait a minute I'm trying to figure out so the cigarette work people could buy it and smoke it and it had very little nicotine in it was that the idea that's correct did it have less nicotine than then would sustain an addiction an addiction in people's brains object to form again I don't know the answer that question not being an addiction expert what that level is and I	 I think I'd be correct in saying I don't think that level threshold level as you said is known well so	 what you're saying is people did not enough Philip Morris didn't make enough money on the product is that what happened object to form people didn't buy the product people didn't want the product nobody bought it it was so small that it was as we've done other test markets around the country if a product is not purchase we don't traditionally try to continue selling them how much money do you need to make off it before you	 so object to form I don't know the answer to that I mean it's a cigarette I mean if we sell a cigarette we sell a cigarette I'm not sure I understand your question well you says it's not a matter of anything other than people just not by in the cigarette why would you keep an eye out there well some people bought it right very few well how many sitting here in number of people I don't know	 well and what year was this this was 89 and 91 timeframe at that time I did did Philip Morris agree in and take a public position that nicotine was addictive so in 89 91 that was shortly off the shortly after the Surgeon General had modified is a definition for addiction if I'm if might	 I'm in is not Incorrect and Philip Morris did question why would we change the definition Philip Morris was certainly an agreement that smoking was hard to quit at that time	 I guess I didn't understand Philip Morris certainly never told anybody that cigarettes were addictive in when it was selling this lower nicotine cigarette right injectable in 1989 we didn't state that know and you just said well you think the Surgeon General just changed the definition of Addiction on you right objective for him I don't think it's a think I think it's a fact	 well okay it you claim it's a fact but did did dozen you talking about the 1988 Surgeon General report yes doesn't 1988 sure to John reports state that even by the earlier definition of addiction that nicotine is addictive objective form I don't know what that report says verbatim I'm certainly talking about cigarettes being addictive and that's when the	 criteria changed enough that cigarette smoking was classified now based on the new definition as being addictive well that's what I said I mean the the Surgeon General in 1988 said even by the it's not a definitional change and even by the old definition it's addictive objective for me Isn't that in the 88 report objective form submit I don't remember the date on the 88 report well if that were in there that would contradict what you're saying about this change in definition you keep talking about	 active form I don't think it would contradict there's no there's no dispute that the definition the criteria by which addiction was meant changed	 and in fact the do the original definition as you call it there was in the 1964 report was taken from the who right	 I'm don't recall the World Health Organization originally had a definition of all addictive drugs it required intoxication right I don't I don't recall back in 64 and sorry and so the World Health Organization change that definition realizing it wasn't correct in I think it was 1968 remember that objective form I don't recall alright well we'll look at the 1988 report in Greater depth and just a little bit but	 Douglas of what your belief of history of the of what nicotine addiction is my question was did you tell people in 1988 or 1989 that cigarettes were addictive yes or no objective for me I don't know of any communication was think that from us well did you state that they were not addictive objective for him I don't know what Communications were made by us in 1989 around addiction	 you were you part you were not with Philip Morris at that time right that is correct but you've looked at the history and you know that Philip Morris belonged to the tobacco Institute which was a public relations group right objective form I know Philip Morris over the years was a member of that organization and so the tobacco Institute would go out in public and say things in comment on the Surgeon General reports among others and comment on different things that were coming up about	 it's a disease correct I think they've commented and many topics over the years related to tobacco and in fact in 1988 they come out and said that cigarettes weren't addictive and this report that the Surgeon General had come out with saying they were addicted was all wrong objective one I don't know exactly what you're referring to be glad to read it for you then okay we will in a second let's go off the record for a minute going off record at 11:12
