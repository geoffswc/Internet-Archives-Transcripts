Jonathan representing the plane is in the New York State action the small plaintiffs the Hoskins plant this the hoberman plaintiffs therefore see the plaintiffs and the zit to plaintiffs Jennifer Breckinridge Hodgins and Berman representing a state,Washington Mark's got black and white in the color representing Philip Morris in the morning today, Steven McConnell of the law firm of Deckard price and roads on behalf of Philip Morris and the Pristina action Diane and I from Chicago and I'm Greg Fowler wish accordion bacon also representing Philip Morris, the deposition began here today and despite the fact that mr. Showbiz is not counsel of record for any of the plaintiffs in the cases that he moment ago referenced we have no objections to mr. cheb going forward and asking questions on behalf of those plaintiffs just so long as there's understood that that that question is on behalf of those plaintiffs that's fair, good morning dr. Cartman I introduced myself a moment ago on the video but my name is Jonathan shove I'm here on behalf of the plaintiffs in the New York action to take your deposition here at this morning before we get started I just want to go over a few ground rules sure mr. Fowler or others have counted you on this but for the record I want to let you, I know that anytime that you need a break in this deposition please either lat mr. Fowler or myself know about that we certainly be happy to accommodate is that clear yes you are aware of course that you're under oath yes you're aware that this deposition is the same force or effect as if you were testifying at court in a courtroom, please for purposes of the transcript give audible responses rather than shaking your head is that clear yes or the court can take it down if you don't if you don't understand a question I'm asking please ask me to rephrase it and I certainly will is that clear yes good it is dr. Carson is that correct that's correct, dr. Cartman have you given deposition testimony before yes when the boy the Boeing case is that the only case you've given testimony and I've been involved in a deposition not as a an employee of the company not related to your work at Philip Morris not related at all, have you testified at a trial before, no, what was your understanding of the Brewing case you said the brain case what was that case it was the flight attendants class action brought by the rosenblatt's down in Miami and the plaintiffs took your deposition in their case yes they did, this is your first face-to-face encounter that's an examiner that's correct in cigarette litigation yes and I interject what you'll need to do is make sure that he's done answering asking the question before you begin to answer part in other words in other words the last episodes was telephonic correct correct did you prepare to give your testimony with Council strike down me rephrase, did you prepare for your deposition today, prepare I met yesterday with with counsel is that the first time that you met with counsel in anticipation of giving deposition testimony in this action probably that's that's correct and you met with whom with the attorneys except for mr. Connell present in this room and how long did you meet with them, several hours did you review documents there, well I don't I don't think so did you prepare for your testimony embroid before you get that deposition, me personally did you meet with your attorneys prior to that deposition yes on how many occasions several, was it more than three, possibly, with a possibly more than five I don't think so, ready those sessions are videotaped you know who did you meet with during your preparation for brewing and if I can just cost you you can tell in this is just an objection based upon the attorney-client privilege you can add answer as to with whom and for how long and so forth but you don't need to go into the substance of that because it's a protected communication Gary what are your from shekhar d, anyone else while Cofer Nicola has sick all from I think that's how you pronounce her last name from shekhar tea with mr. Fowler involved in any of those meetings, I don't I don't believe so you believe yesterday was the first time you met mr. Fowler person person face-to-face object to the form, did that before yes, do you review documents in any of the other session in the three to five sessions that you had excuse me where that took place in preparation for the deposition of groin, yes did any of those documents refresh your recollection as to any of the contents that were contained in those documents in other words did you read something that then brought back or refresh your recollection is to what the subjects were that were contained in those memos or documents object to the form of the question as to vagueness with regard to refresh recollection, you can answer it as you know occasionally mr. Fowler is going to interpose Jefferson sometimes more occasionally than others but you can you can answer the question unless he instructs you not to or actually should answer the question unless he instructs you not to answer can you repeat the question sure did any of the documents that you look at refresh your recollection as to the subjects or facts that were contained in those documents you know, were those three to five sessions do they last full days you know with we're they at least half days sometimes no more than half days no more than happens, did you read your poem testimony since she's after you after you gave it yes, did you make any corrections to that testimony yes, were they substantive changes or strike that where they substance of changes for example mean it's been a while since I I looked at it I misunderstood one of mr. Hogg's questions and my answer was was not not correct and I change that, what was the question that you misunderstood the question the question related to when I became a full professor at the medical school in relationship to my achieving tenure, with her other questions that you change that had substantive, implications there was no objection the phone the question you asked me to change some questions sorry answers when we start over whether any other answers that you change that your mind had substantive implications not that I can recall, at the time that you read that the testimony in that it's time that you read the testimony you gave them growing, was there anything, that you testify to that you did not believe to be true at the time that we start over at the time that you read the transcript is there anything that you testified to that you would change no, you've been with RPM and we'll talk more as we can refer to as p.m. since 1989 is that correct the end of 1988, is there a project or projects that you have in your mind that you're most proud of, well it Flavia of your work that you've done well it felt worse several, without listing them in any priority order could you tell me the projects that you have in your mind the several projects one family of projects relates to investigations associated with environmental tobacco smoke, that's one Family Programs other other other projects and other family of programs deals with the development and Technology associated with new products, are there other projects you have in your mind and finally another family of projects dealing with issues associated with product integrity, what do you mean by product Integrity product Integrity within the context of my context are those those issues that are associated in part with making sure that the products we sell comply with all laws and regulations wherever their sold, around the world the either meet them and or exceed them, when did you work on, projects, involving product Integrity from the end of 1988 until the present and you're still working on that is that correct yes, when did you work on product projects involving the development of Technology vis-ÌÊ-vis new products from the beginning to the present, what about products involving ETS I'm sorry could you repeat that question, I mean I might have misspoke what about product projects involving environmental tobacco smoke since 1992 to the present yes, from 89 to 90 to what projects did you work on it p.m., I'm not sure I understood that quiz I can Community came to the company at the beginning of 1989 and of 88 yes what were you what what project did you first work on when you came to the company for the first one and a half years my primary responsibility was in the area of product integrity, okay that takes us to the mid-90s a 1991 okay and at that point I felt I was given an additional assignment and what was that that was manager of biochemical research, who did you succeed in that position dr. Kathy Ellis, how old are you manager biochemical research approximately a year and a half 92 maybe 94 know until 1992 from the mid-90s midnight mid-1990 right, what types of projects did you work on work strike that did you do any Hands-On research when your manager biochemical research, me personally right know what types of projects were being worked on in the biochemical research Department in the mid-1990s from mid 1992 1992 there was responsibility for an entomology group, which played a very important role in terms of quality, since this is a natural Agricultural Product that we primarily deal with there are bugs that like to eat tobacco and so the entomology group played a very important role in trying to deal with the quality of the product it was a microbiological group that again played a quality role in terms of making sure we didn't have any microbiological problems associated, the manufacturing of the product there was a molecular biology group whose whose role was to clone sequence and then patent some a gene that was felt to be play important role in nicotine synthesis and in the tobacco plant, there was a group whose function was to look at ways of reducing certain constituents that were in Smoke there was a group whose role was to look at certain biological attributes of nicotine, I think I've captured the the major groups there may have been some smaller subgroups working on some some things but I believe they would be related to these General topics that I just I just mentioned, let's just go off the record for mood 11:15, dr. Clarkson in your last answer you attempted to outline the projects that were ongoing in the biochemical research division now I just want to ask you some questions about each of the different projects were ongoing first of all with respect to the microbiological group was there a formal name to that project or a bill, code number objective for the question as to time but you can go ahead and start it during the my questions are limited to the time that you were managing the biochemical research division let me let me just rephrase and start over is this biochemical research division maximum within the R&D unit of felt Mars it was it was who was in charge of R&D and felt more, it's during this time period dr. Kenneth Helton, will you report it to dr. Houghton counting at that time you know who are you reporting to the two people and they're reporting to dr. Jim Charles vice president of research and that related to the product integrity, area and to dr. Kathy Ellis who was director of research and I reported to her because of my responsibilities as manager of biochemical research was there a, formal name to the microbiological group that you mentioned a couple minutes ago yes what was that I don't remember, I believe you mentioned that group was looking at certain microbiological problems is that fair that you said that the group studying certain microbiological problems and connection with tobacco object to the form of the question you can answer my recollection was that that was not the the answer I gave to the question the the group's, action was primarily a quality assurance, function, who headed up that group, the section the section leader who had a number of groups reporting to him was a scientist named dr. Robert McEwen, and the technical person who actually ran the group from day to day was mrs. Deborah chaddock, was there a specific principle project that that group was working on during the period you were managing biochemical research, one of the major projects was to develop a rapid and accurate method for determining organisms that would be would be or might be present in tobacco, Pleasant method for detecting where it is for detecting organisms that might be or would be in tobacco achieved, a melt a method was developed its, what types of organisms were you attempting to analyze since tobacco is a Agricultural Product the kinds of microorganisms that you would expect to see would be those associated with the soil and those are primarily the ones that ended up finding, you mentioned nicotine synthesis what does that mean object to the form of the question nice absolutely I'm just you mentioned in the molecular bio group that there was some study of a gene that plays an important role in nicotine synthesis and a tobacco plant you call that testimony yes what did you mean by that as a Layman I'm not understanding that terminology, the tobacco plant makes nicotine from base components building blocks like putting up this building you start with bricks so there are bricks that go into making nicotine and in the process of making nicotine from these bricks the tobacco plant has uses proteins that are enzymes and they changed the form of these bricks and allow them to come together, so you basically build the nicotine molecule and we were studying one of the key enzymes that were involved in the tobacco plants ability to make nicotine, why were you studying the enzymes that were involved in the tobacco plants ability to make nicotine if you have an understanding as to why you work there were at least two two reasons for doing this, one one reason had to do with the fact that there was product development activity to try and develop products that would deliver little or no nicotine through the use of a cigarette, the other reason was a scientific reason dealing with an allegation that had been made as to nicotine being a source of tobacco-specific nitrosamines so this was a tool one of the tools to help investigate that allegation that had been made in the scientific literature what's a tobacco, Civic neutrons to me tobacco-specific nitrosamines is an atrocity that is unique to to tobacco, you're familiar with the term a rtk all capped as it relates to work at Philip Morris or projects of Philip Morris, I think so what is the product development activity that you just mentioned with respect to trying to produce a tobacco product with little or no nicotine related to the art project it was a parallel path, freebie by the time I understand our visit to where parallel means but what do you how you use it in this context if if a goal was to develop a commercial product that delivered little or no nicotine technologically there could be several ways to get there, are you are you familiar with the different ways that Philip Morris was investigating, the development of our product that had a little or no nicotine I'm familiar with several ways I'm not I can't say that I'm familiar with all the guys that do one was through supercritical extraction is that correct yes, was that the method that was actually used to commercially Market a cigarette with little or no - jet to the form of the question yes, whether other, methods that were used, to commercially, sell a cigarette with a little or no nicotine, I'm going to check the question is is vague and it would you mind reading that back, when there are other methods that were used to commercially sell a cigarette with little or no - Let me let me try a different way to ask it, I'll talk Morrison was researching different ways to, develop a cigarette with little or no nicotine at one point in time at least correct yes, we you testified that the supercritical extraction method was actually implemented in the, sale of a, cigarette with a little or no nicotine correct yes what I'm trying to get at is whether other methods that were looked at that what would that were not implemented as the supercritical extraction method was on a commercial basis, if the answer is yes it was the supercritical extraction method the only method that was actually used to develop and commercially Market a cigarette with little or no no, let me make sure that we're talking about the same thing when you say supercritical fluid extraction if you're referring to the use of carbon dioxide then the answer is yes because there are many many ways to do supercritical extraction with other materials but was and that that is what I'm talking about but let me just ask you a follow-up question to that thing, don't want to study various supercritical extraction methods before deciding on the carbon dioxide method yes, how many other extraction methods were were looked at by Philip Morris during that the period that they were trying to develop the the cigarette containing little or no nicotine, several, generally could you list for me those methods that were looked at not all of them the ones that you know they looked at several different solvents in addition to carbon dioxide, more than three less than 12 look specific ones I can't recall okay, do you know why they settled on carbon dioxide I believe so why is that to two reasons at least one that Philip Morris had has been using supercritical fluid extraction in the coffee side of the business to remove caffeine so the technology and the expertise were available in another part of the, the company so that technological and Commercial feasibility was a real possibility, and those were the reasons caress the two reason to hear what other methods, did Philip Morris look at, in terms of, ways in which to commercially sell a product with little or no nicotine other than the supercritical extraction, as I mentioned earlier the genetic molecular work was was a parallel path to the art to the art process and when we say art process for the record we're talking about the process in which the supercritical fluid extraction method is used correct yes, could you elaborate on the genetic molecular work that you mentioned in terms of what Philip Morris did with respect to trying to develop that as a method of reducing or eliminating nicotine objective form its broad really calls for a narrative I can talk about the parts that I, is associated with it this program preceded Me by by several years and in which case I should interpose a foundation objection as well from Kyle well I don't have a problem with you you know Posey objectives grab rather the next time in you wait till he's finished this is an certainly oppose it and you can keep on I'm sorry to interrupt initially this was prior to my employment Philip Morris they tried to do this work outside, in some commercial facilities that had some expertise experience in doing this kind of cloning not specifically with tobacco where this Gene that was not a success and so they developed a program internally within within our D and that went on until about 92 when they, we appear to have completed the work and written up some patents to to describe what what we had we had done and that was to isolate the gene clone the gene identify identify the protein and create genetically modified tobacco plants in which the levels of nicotine were significantly reduced, that work continues today but not within our D but this supported in Laboratories outside of R&D, as you understand it is Philip Morris attempting to genetically modify the tobacco plant in order to commercially sell cigarettes that, have, little or no nicotine in them as a result of the use of these tobacco plants that was one of the two intense say that was that's not the present intent, the present the present intent is to continue continue that work as I said what we thought we had isolated it turns out was not, what we had originally thought, we had isolated a gene product but it wasn't the gene product that, we thought we were we had found, when you came to head up the biochemical research Department did Philip Morris have the technology available to it at that point to genetically modify tobacco plant to sell product that had reduced nicotine no does it have that capability today no, you.you're carpeted attempt to monitor the technological capabilities of your competitors object to the form that question yes are you aware of any tobacco companies and you consider to be competitors having the ability to genetically alter or modify the tobacco plant, sell product with reduced nicotine, could you read that question back for this, considered to be compared as having the ability to genetically alter or modify the tobacco plant to sell a product if we do sneaky things, you go in that yes, and which companies are referring to I don't know the name of the company but I believe it's in Buffalo New York in the church under say that they have the technology to genetically modify tobacco plant to sell, let me strike that, question and ask you this, what type of Technology are you referring to that that company Buffalo has well they bought the rights to a technology developed by dr. Mark conkling at North Carolina State University, that has the potential, for lowering nicotine synthesis and tobacco plants, are you aware of any efforts of Philip Morris to genetically modified tobacco plant to raise the nicotine synthesis and tobacco you know all efforts that you're aware of them into lower than nicotine level yes, how long are you aware of the technology existing that you mentioned that was developed in North Carolina State object to the form of the question you go ahead I'm not sure I understand that of course you said the company in Buffalo brought the rights bought the rights to a technology developed by an individual at North Carolina State University correct yes do you know how long, the technology existed that was purchased from North Carolina State University yes how long has that technology than to students of dr. conkling's that have done the work just defended their graduate work their thesis this last summer down at NC State, so what in your view, is a Tom strike that when do you believe the technology, has been available, let me try try something that my answer to one of your questions was that they bought the rights to a potential there's been no no demonstration that this approach will work in tobacco, little own tobacco in the field, the Q just seems tween tobacco and tobacco in the field absolutely how do you how do you make that distinction or straight out why do you make that distinction, the genetic constructs that are developed in the laboratory, r, either single sell tobacco plants or, small tobacco plants that normally should find their way to a greenhouse and then the seeds collected and what you're looking for is a heritable genetic transformation in which the properties that you think you've developed into test tube will persist in future Generations that has not been accomplished to date from the NC State work, doctor are you a toxicologist by training I'm a toxicologist by education by training by experience, are you a pharmacologist yes, by training education experience in sales are there any other areas that you consider yourself to be, strike that what other subspecialties would you say you have education training experience and other than toxicology and pharmacology objective the form we go ahead and answer using those very broad terms right biology in general and biostatistics, you mentioned and I'm bringing you back to when you you were managing the biochemical research division that there was a group working on the reduction of certain constituents correct yes was there a formal name to that group yes what was that again I don't I don't remember, true called the billing code for that group that's specifically what I don't what I don't 69 08 could be smoke condensate studies was that the name of the group that was some of the work that they did whether that was the name of the group or not I don't recall at that point was Robin kids are heading that group up Robin Kinser was the section leader, she had other responsibilities but that was one of them was there someone that was she reporting to you yes Ali was there anyone else that I was a supervisor in that project of reducing certain constituents, objective form, supervisory role dr. Walter hanfling had a supervisory role at various points in time in that, what constituents are you referring to, object to the form of the question it's vague, one would be tobacco-specific nitrosamines, how many, tobacco-specific nitrosamines exist in tobacco in tobacco right the dodging is tobacco, don't say that six, how many T essays are there in smoke cigarette smoke got the same, the same six, I don't remember, I believe you also said that when you headed up the biochemical research group there was activities aimed at looking at the biological attributes of nicotine you recall that get to the point of question, yes, what specifically were straight down who is who project leader of this group yes who is that dr. Frankel OTA, was dr. Gloria reporting to you at this time no, who is dr. Gloria reporting chill in the section leader I believe it was dr. Robin Kinser, so this project look at the biological attributes of nicotine fell under the umbrella of dr. Kinder's supervisory responsibilities yes and the doctor comes our report to you yes, what biological attributes of nicotine was dr. Gordon looking at objection on the basis of foundation, if you know you can answer the question, okay it's okay you don't the way for me to tell you that if you can if you understand the question you have the basis for it well we don't have to answer any questions after that you don't understand we already went through that and if you don't have a basis for answering I'm sure you'll you'll tell me and Greg certain doesn't beat it the majors on that the major aspect or thrust of work dealt with the subjective attributes associated with smoking and nicotine, to distinguish, worked on to study the subjective attributes the soda was associated with smoking from a study of this subjective attributes is associated with nicotine could you repeat the question sure do you distinguish work done to study the subjective attributes associated with smoking from the study of the subjective attributes associated with nicotine I do make that distinction and how do you draw that distinction, well strike that why did you draw that distinction, nicotine is but one single component that's found in tobacco smoke there are lots of smoke smoke components that contribute to the subjective impact associated with smoking in addition to nicotine and those components both individually and collectively by themselves or together with nicotine, can have different or play different subjective roles in the smoking experience, why don't we take a short break we was on a while, there are lots of smoke components that contribute to the subjective impact associated with smoking I want to in addition it contains and I wanted to follow up on that answer first of all what are the different smoke opponents that you believe contribute to this jet of impact associated with smoking beside the nicotine objective phone question with regard to Foundation, tobacco smoke can really be described as being composed of a gas phase and a particulate phase and each one of those phases has an ability to subjectively impact, the individual who smokes nicotine is found in the particulate phase of mainstream smoke the gas phase components include a variety of materials some of them are volatile volatile materials that are naturally present in tobacco some of them are volatile materials that we add to the tobacco in the man, factor of cigarettes specifically to have a subjective impact, mush mush, what in your mind dr. Carson are the, gas phase components that contribute to the subjective impact associated with smoking I know you just gave me a broad and so I'm wondering more specifically what does components are and let's break it down even further by those that are naturally present in tobacco and those that are added objective want to start with a naturally present gas phase, let's let's talk about those natural components that are found in the smoke, rather than simply those that are found in in the in the tobacco okay, there's a large there are a large family of compounds that has what are called aldehyde functionalities, there are probably dozens and dozens of such compounds that are generated when one smokes a cigarette from the tobacco Creek generated from the tobacco and one smokes a cigarette, are there other components outside of the aldehyde family that are naturally found in smoke that contributes to the subjective impact associated with smoking one that comes to mind is ammonia ammonia sorry, an ammonia is naturally found in tobacco and smoke and and in tobacco as well, are there others other, components other than those in the out of my family and ammonia that are found in the gas phase that contribute to the subjective impact associated with smoking chips and for the question at this point probably the there are and it's been described by leffingwell and I'm in a monograph and I can't recall all of the different compounds and all of the different phases that they're located but that that's been documented in the literature what monograph are you referring to, leffingwell is the is the author of The monograph, what about the components that are added to, Tobacco in the Gap all strike that what what are the components you are referring to when you said some are found naturally and some are added, objective form the question are you to ask me what's added yes yeah we had to Tobacco in the manufacture of cigarettes a variety of aromatic compounds, g.i. anything else to tobacco and the manufacturer servants yes that contribute to the subjective impact associated with smoking yes other than aromatic compounds yes what other families of compounds water for for example, what else family functional grouping called humectants in addition to water so glycerol or glycerin would be an example of that and glycerol and glycerin or different chemicals correct no they're not saying, other than aromatic compounds water humectants what else is added to sugars, tobacco to contribute to the subjective impact associated with sorry okay you thought I was done I basically was but I just wanted to record Two Sugars if I could just interject for a moment this testimony may meet the standard of confidential or highly confidential given the protective order in this case not like to provisionally Mark the deposition transcript as confidential and or highly confidential to be worked out, after the deposition is transcribed pursuant to the to the protective order okay all right that's fine this is hardly confidential stuff but you can mark it will be getting to that point soon when you'll really want to mark it but other than sugars what else is added to tobacco, that contributes to the subjective impact associated with smoking object to the form the question we go ahead and answer those are the major ones, you mentioned that nicotine is found in the particulate phase is that correct of mainstream so mainstream smoke is that, distinguished from where nicotine is found in sidestream Smoke yes we're nicotine found in sidestream Smoke primarily in the gas phase, what is mainstream smoke doctor mainstream smoke is is the result of combustion and pyrolysis of of tobacco and as I said earlier it's composed of a particular phase and the gas phase and it's a smoke that a smoker inhales it can be yes, does the smoke that comes off the rod excuse me is that means for your size 4, this isn't held by smoker the smoke that comes off a rod in between in the puff interval between the Puffs is side string and what about the smoke that's inhaled as a result of taking a puff of a cigarette into a smokers lungs that's mainstream it's what we call Mainstream smoke, and is it correct to say that a person that's sitting in a room with someone that's smoking a cigarette is taking, strike that is being subjected to sidestream smoke object to the form of the question incomplete hypothetical forgot that go ahead you haven't given enough information for me to answer that question, if you and I are sitting in a room with a door that's closed normal ventilation in a 5x7 room and you're smoking a cigarette an  exhaling blowing into the air is a reasonable chance that I sitting next to you are being subjected to sidestream smoke object to the form of the question it calls for an	 opinion as far as I can see and it also is not relevant to the issues in this case but it is relevant but you can see if I can ask sure you would question what do you mean by normal ventilation well we're actually making this a little more complicated I think been then I want to because I'm really just asking you a question about the	 nicotine that's found in the gas phase as a result sidestream smoke I'm just trying to ask you this question if I like individual that's not smoking am I being subjected to nicotine into my body and some sort as a result of the sidestream smoke that might be coming off the rod that's really what I'm trying to get to this I'm not trying to get to a scientific discussion of sidestream smoke or control test conditions or anything like that	 let's inject if you can answer the question go ahead more than likely	 are you familiar with the terms with the term protonated and unprotonated nicotine	 I believe so yes what does protonated nicotine mean to dr. nicotine can exist in various states of protonation depending upon the environment in which the is is found and protonation just has to do with the number of hydrogen's or electrons that might be associated with a with a molecule the charge if you will	 what state is the nicotine that one takes in as a	 strike that what state is nicotine in if I for me if I were to sit here now and inhale a Marlboro cigarette object to the form of the question	 we're talking about mainstream smoke right mainstream smoke G given everything that is known and understood it would probably mirror primarily be in the protonated one of the protonated states	 it could also put it not be delivered to me in the unprotonated state in part Define what you mean by delivered	 in other words when I take when I inhale the cigarette that contains nicotine it is conceivable is it not that some of the nicotine that I'm ingesting is being done in the unprotonated state object to the form the questions and you complete hypothetical we still talk about the mainstream smoke yes we're going to talk about mainstream smoke the answer to	 given the answer to that question when I said that in large part it was in the protonated state there therefore there is a possibility that some small proportion of that is in the non protonated State and what does that depend on Doctor whether the nicotine strike two on me rephrase it	 what factor or factors determine whether the nicotine is delivered in the protonated or unprotonated state with respect to mainstream smoke and we're talking about inhalation of inhalation right see the major factor would be the buffering capacity of the of the organism Fatima being the buffering capacity of that individual	 and does the	 trick that how	 striked out what do you mean by buffering capacity can you explain that to 21 with a second grade level as me and chemistry basically if you look around this room we're sort of bags of salty water to reduce us to all the same the same level and for all of us	 almost everything you have in your body is driven to maintain a pH of seven point four and you was a bag of salty water have systems in place that tried to keep everything around that pH 7 .4 and that that would be normally considered physiological pH you have enzymes you have gases you have counter ion	 whose major responsibility is to keep the system in that in that equilibrium	 the blood in your body is about pH 77.4 if you would to measure the pH in the cells that would be seven point for The Only Exception would be parts of your kidney or it would be slightly more acidic	 and that's the buffering capacity that you're referring to to maintain the pH is close to 7.4 as possible	 are you all familiar doctor with a term smoke pH yes what does that mean to you scientifically Yes means nothing okay it means something to you in some other way operationally what's operationally amazing how what does it mean to operationally	 there were some reports in the scientific literature in which investigators had reported on the measurement of something they call the pH of smoke those papers that were published and the methodology that was used for things that were investigated by us over a long period of time and I think operation	 when I see smoke pH I quickly think back to that our use of smoke pH is basically driven by these published reports from the outside that attempted to develop methodologies to measure smoke pH	 what are you referring to when you say there were reports in the literature which investigators had reported on the measurement of pH of smoke and that you had investigated	 the methodology that was used I'm not sure I understand what you mean you just asked about what literature he's referring to right what was what why what was of interest to	 Dietrich Hoffman published and colleagues published a paper from the American Health Foundation reporting a methodology for measuring the pH of smoke	 and so I think the responsible course of action for a company like Philip Morris is to examine the scientific information in the methodology in that in that paper and that's what we've done	 you know what	 straight that did that the Hoffman literature that you're referring to actually measure the ph and smoker just found a methodology for measuring it	 interesting phrase of the question they are really not intended so they reported both on the fact that they had found a methodology for measuring pH of smoke and measured the said they measure the pH of smoke	 what was pmo's interested in the methodology or the actual quantification jet to the form of the question or both	 it's way before way before my time are you aware of the investigation that film are conducted response to the Hoff and literature that you're referring to in part and it is your knowledge allow you to answer the question as to whether Philip Morris was	 starting of the methodology that	 Hoffman wrote for measured about with respect to measuring pH or was it the actual pH measurements that he found	 I think the answer is you have to answer the first to even bother about the center and so you have to establish whether the methodology is a legitimate scientific methodology and the once you've made that determination you may or may not decide to proceed it Philip Morris make a determination as far as you understand with respect to the	 the	 issue whether the methodology was a legitimate scientific determination	 the the situation as it regards the measurement of smoke pH was one that was known then and know now that it is scientifically it's not it's not based on science to be able to measure pH of smoke	 are you saying that smoke pH is scientifically a meaningless term subject of the film the question if we're talking about tobacco smoke PS the answer is yes	 in general terms and maybe even a layman's terms you say one cannot measure pH of smoke yes attempt to measure pH of smoke yes do you have an understanding as to what the qualifications were with respect to the measurement of pH and smoke injectable form of the question I have I have a recollection of what he reported	 what did he report smoke pH values and these this was in a number of I think a number of studies smoke pH values for different kinds of products	 do you recall the range	 it was on the slightly acidic to slightly above neutral which would be from about six and a half maybe two 775	 as thought were studied the delivery of nicotine	 straight to his foot were studied the delivery of bound or strike that has Philip Morris delivered the delivery of nicotine and protonated as opposed to unprotonated forms could you read that question back	 laps and all the strikes yeah just the last will and I think you said delivered twice okay I have another let me let me start out has felt more studied the delivery of nicotine in	 protonated versus unprotonated forms an objective the form of the question the	 term delivery is vague and ambiguous okay it's all it's a term that Philip Morris consistently uses in its literature so that's why it works and it's document so that's why I thought maybe if I use that dr. Clark's with might be familiar with it but you're going to get in context okay even if you understand the question go ahead and answer but I don't understand the question that's great can we can we try the question again	 what's asking again	 any efforts	 on Philip Morris is part to study the delivery of protonated versus unprotonated nicotine seem objection object to the form the question vague and ambiguous	 the only work that I'm aware of that specifically deals with the protonated state of nicotine is work that's been going on recently as a result of some Publications doctor pankow comes to come to mind in terms of that	 so there are efforts underway from a chemistry and physics perspective to try to understand his study his observations and his conclusions and any relationship they may have to the product what are you referring to with respect to dr. pan cows doctor literature sorry sure dr. pankow has published at least two pieces that that I'm aware of	 that our laboratory laboratory studies with nicotine and tobacco smoke condensate looking at the role of gases and the removal of nicotine who changing the physical location of nicotine and potentially changing the protonated state of nicotine	 from a pharmacological perspective doctor	 is there a difference in the delivery of nicotine and protein adverse unprotonated States objectively Quest will talk about cigarette smoke yes	 are we talking about	 an intact organism we talking about she will single cells we talked about from a pharmacological tools perspective with respect to humans and we're not limiting our discussion to nicotine or just specifically to nicotine well specifically to nicotine and I want to know whether there	 there's a difference in the delivery of nicotine in protonated versus unprotonated States objective form of the question theoretically theoretically in the absence of dilution and buffering capacity there could be a difference	 the what would what would that difference be the theoretical difference would be based upon the fact that the non protonated or uncharged version of nicotine would be less impeded Crossing cell membranes than the protonated or charged forms would be and when you say less impeded in layman's terms would it be fair to say that would increase the amount of nicotine absorption that would take place in a smoker's mouth	 object to the form of the question we have to make it very clear we're talking about in this theoretical framework rather than actual smoking Behavior means it has to be very clear so it's not confusing on the record mr. Fowler I'm I appreciate your attempt at cleaning up my record and I'm not sure we could we could we could we could actually give me a deposition lecture maybe outside of this deposition but I strenuously objected	 to your what I consider to be blatant reframing of the question and therefore I'd ask you to keep your objections very short and simple with with a limited amount of editorializing which was certainly not the case with yo ass objection you can ask your doctor for you know I just to refer I apologize I just want to make sure the record is perfectly clear and not misleading and I'm not trying to impede your question and and you have your opportunity to question this witness and make the record is clear unclear as you'd like but I certainly don't want you to	 have to clear the record up all my time or I'll my deposition and I appreciate that you can answer me you don't mind if I ask to hear I certainly would expect that after that interference could the court reporter repeat the question but before you do I objected to the characterization is interference	 when you say left impeded in layman's terms would it be fair to say that that would increase the amount of nicotine absorption that would take place in the same objection is the same response you can you haven't provided enough definition to the question to for me to give for me to give an answer what	 is lacking in my question vis-ÌÊ-vis the definition that renders you on it unable to answer the the term you left out has to do with a Time Dimension and how does the time Dimension preclude your ability to answer my question as it was stated because whatever differences may exist are kinetochore rate	 rate differences	 what do you mean by that	 we started the this deposition at 10:50 and we took a break and came back at 12 something that's an interval of time during that time events occurred excuse me for using my camel events events occurred If instead of less than two hours we had looked at 1 hour	 the rate at which events occurred may have been the same but if you would have stopped it at that point in time the amount	 that would have occurred would be different that those those two different points of time assuming a similar change in time that's what I mean by by rate okay so if you charge $400 an hour and work for 42 hours you would get $800 but if you only work for an hour you get $400 that that's what I'm talking about okay why don't we add a ton element to my question or my	 of three questions ago and say usually the rate of	 from the time a smoker Puffs on a cigarette and inhales the smoke a few seconds maybe it is then it fair to say that	 in the unprotonated form the amount of nicotine absorption that would take place in the smokers mouth would increase you know I'm not trying to be difficult if we eliminate dilution if we eliminate buffering capacity than it's theoretically possible okay you're not being difficult at all doctor cars just specific	 would it also be true in that same hypothetical I gave you at the same transfer speed that the amount of absorption that would take place	 we rephrase it would also be fair to say that the rate of transfer in that time frame of nicotine to the brain would increase theoretically subject to the full with the with the factors of that you have just interposed in your last answer	 object to the form a little less could you repeat the question the question sure	 would it be fair to say also that	 rate of transfer of nicotine to the brain	 would increase	 in the delivery of nicotine in a non protonated State as opposed to a protonated state objective form the question incomplete hypothetical	 you can answer give me a moment to	 think about that sure	 I would then have to add another boundary condition here and that is you would have to eliminate both The Binding of nicotine to cells and protein in the blood as well as the buffering capacity of the blood and under those those hypothetical	 conditions	 it's possible that that could happen has felt more studied the question as far as you know of	 weather	 increased on protein nicotine increases the	 amount of nicotine absorption that takes place in a smoker's mouth	 I don't know where are you aware of any research or studies conducted by Philip Morris that considers the	 delivery of nicotine and unprotonated states were in a nun protonated State object in the form of the question	 go back to our previous discussion on the work that's being done related to the panco pain calc is that the first that you were aware of of film or studying the delivery on protein nicotine in any context	 Jetta for the question	 by study what what what what do you mean I mean any any resources that are devoted in any way	 to the analysis	 of unprotonated nicotine as delivered to humans seem objection to the form you can take if we go back in time to 1990 for Congressional hearings mr. Waxman and allegations that initially started out talking about spiking with nicotine move to manipulation	 and then move to ammonia and the use of ammonia and the nod protonated nicotine question there was some fair amount of discussions within our d as to what these allegations were what was the scientific basis for them what data if any did we have	 and the physics the chemistry or anything else that would help us understand what was being alleged in the relevance of those allegations	 other than discussions in R&D and I mean discussions in the sense you just used it in your previous answer was there any scientific investigation done in response to any of the allegations that centered around the 1994 hearings to new just described I think that dr. Lily Cliff Lily and colleagues	 I had undertaken an exhaustive search and calculation of the chemistry and physics literature as a relates to what was known about nicotine and that continues today in response to the allegations that have been made in here he's in at various literature that's correct	 what was your understanding of allegations of spiking of nicotine	 what was your understanding of the allegations that Philip Morris had engaged in was engaged in the spiking of nicotine objective for the question but if you understand that you go ahead and answer them the primary allegation was that Philip Morris specifically added nicotine in the manufacture of of	 and I think dr. Kessler was if not the first one of the first people to make that allegation and was your understanding that that allegation involved the manufacturing of cigarettes in the are L reconstituted Leaf process it didn't start out that way this is sort of my my opinion creep it started out with adding exaggerated as nicotine and	 that initially involved the use of tobacco extracts or use of nicotine sulfate as a denaturant when those allegations were scientifically proved to be specious the allegation then Crete to why didn't we why did we put the nicotine back in the sheet making process after we had	 taking it out and then that allegation creeped when that proved to be not a very fruitful approach in terms of allegations per se to the ammonia manipulation which is sort of where we are where we are now	 when you say the allegations regarding the ADI of nicotine would prove to be scientifically	 thank you species of what science are what scientific data are you referring to them it's actually very straightforward simple simple information one it relates to the amount of nicotine sulfate that's used as a denaturing which was something that was approved by the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms	 we're if you calculated the amount of nicotine sulfate in the denature and solution that would be on a cigarette analytically there was no methodology that was currently available that could even measure it when it came to Tobacco extracts I think the the same calculations proved the same conclusion that the nicotine that would be	 aunt in extracts of tobacco that had been used as flavor material did not contribute in any way to the amount of nicotine in the tobacco nor did nor did it produce any change in nicotine delivered in in the smoke that could be measured	 I do understand your your response to be that	 it's scientifically speeches because the amount of nicotine that may be added are so minimal as to be not even a blip on a radar screen because it's so small you can't measure	 try it again let me try again are you saying that the reason why those allegations are scientifically unfounded those being the atom nicotine is that the amounts of nicotine that are added in tobacco extract or through the use of nicotine sulfate are so small as to not	 even capable of measurement of just the food	 the allegations that were made were not simply that we added nicotine but we added nicotine for some functional purpose other than in the manufacture of cigarettes and in that context my answer is yes other words the amount of nicotine that you might add could not start that the amount of nicotine that you might add could not have any Sinister purpose	 because it's so low level as to not be capable of having any impact it has no function no I'm sorry objection it has no functional activity in any way shape or form and insert data at felt more to support the statement that you just made that it has no functional activity in any way shape or form is there studies that that that Philip Morris is conducted that's	 supports that statement yes	 what studies are you referring to in your mind that support that statement	 when the allegations were first raised I believe in 94 scientists within our D said about determining the amounts of these materials how they were used documented that and did did the calculations as well as performing some analytical analytical studies to confirm the paper calculations	 what scientists are you referring to dr. Carter	 there are a number of a number of scientists I would say again dr. Lilly would have been it would have been involved in in this dr. Ellis dr. Houghton not necessarily in doing the actual worker but in helping direct it out of those three doctors Lily else and how often would you say one would have more primary responsibility for this the direction and or Supervision in that project or you're not just you just not sure I'm not sure	 when you say there were allegations around the time of the hearings 1994 regarding the manipulation of the kateed what did you mean by that what was your understanding that allegation	 the objective for the question	 at that point my recollection was that had it had to do with the uh with the RL process	 do you have an understanding as to allegations that were made with respect to the manipulation nicotine of the RL process vaguely	 are you familiar with the are L process	 vaguely like when I came to Philip Morris I had a tour of the facility but I have not been back since have you done any work while you are felt Mars that interfaces with the RL process or supports the RL process and anyway	 the only work that I can think of that might touch upon that would have to do with the with ingredients or components that would be associated with the process	 the ingredients being for example Bonilla phosphate is that an ingredient that you're referring to an answer that is ingredient yes and that's added in the URL process yes why is that added in the URL process the mountain diammonium phosphate objection of lack of foundation what's the base of a counselor even asking whether he knows anything about I just ask them what they're doing	 that the Oriole process he said vaguely that's exactly well then it's a lack of knowledge rather than actual Foundation but go ahead you can answer if you can	 it's been a very long time since I've been involved in in in that in terms of a specific a specific ingredient and in the process so is it fair to say you don't know why diammonium phosphate is used in the URL why is that in the URL process generally speaking the things that are added in the process or either added to facilitate the process	 wow the processing to take place and or contribute some subjective character to the product that's being used in the cigarette	 which category does the da pieced and fall into I think it's the first two	 did you do anything is added in the URL process that contributes to the subjective character of the product	 I probably did but I don't write no no no is nitrate taken out of straight As nitrate extracted in any shape in any way shape or form and the RL process I believe so	 the why is nitrates taken out of tobacco and they are L process if you know	 the removal of nitrate is in large measure a consequence of the public health communities expression of concern about nitrate and its contribution to smoke constituents specifically the form the formation of TSA is no not specifically but other other compounds would they be pH is know what compounds your burn	 oxides of nitrogen	 and that oxides of nitrogen linked with TSN a formation	 in the laboratory yes they've been linked with any other constituent of smoker tobacco that has caught the attention of the Public Health Community they meaning baby	 oxides of nitrogen the oxides of nitrogen themselves are positive by certain members of the Public Health Community of being a concern a concern because of	 association with carcinogens what's the concern	 that you as far as you understand the concern and we're talking about the concern of the Public Health Community with respect to oxides of nitrogen thing they represent unstable reactive molecules that were felt to have a variety of potential biological effects	 when you remove nitrates in the are L process do you add that back in anyway Jen to the phone the manufacturer let me start this Philip Morris add nitrates back in the are L process after they've been removed not that I'm aware this Philip Morris extract nicotine the RL process	 as part of the process for making RL the water-soluble Czar removed of which nicotine is present and then are the water-soluble is then added back to the base web to make the product yes and the contains nicotine correct yes why your mind does Phillip Morris not	 handle the water the water solubles in the same way they handle the nitrates in other words why don't they just take out the water solubles and not add that back at a later point in time I'm going to reject the form of the question based upon a lack of foundation being established with this witness you've asked the compound question okay you can deal with it	 it supports will if you need the question rephrase you can have it rephrase to especially	 could we try the question again sure what I'm what I'm trying to get at is do you have an understanding as to why the water-soluble is are not dealt with in the same manner as the nitrates in that nitrates are removed from the product and they are L process and never added back whereas water	 solubles are removed and then added back to the base web to make reconstituted tobacco and yes I did okay	 and what does that if you've ever tried to smoke base web without the solubles it's not it's non smokable if you want to get an example when next time you go to the grocery store and get one of the paper bags try to smoke smoke the paper bag could you add the water solubles back without adding the nicotine gentle formula question based upon Foundation I don't know how the water-soluble czar	 indispensable part I'm sorry the nicotine is an indispensable part of the water-soluble genitive form the question no I'm just not aware of a way to specifically remove the the nicotine and then add the the non nicotine on nicotine containing water soluble is back is it your understanding dr. Carson that nicotine contribute to the subjective impact of smoking	 yes and what way	 several several ways	 one in terms of taste in terms of smell and in terms of stimulation of various parts of the trigeminal nerve pathway in the back of the mouth and the throat and possibly that c fibers in the lung	 are you aware of the term impact as relates to smoking smoking packed I've heard the term yes what's that mean to you	 generally it's a term of art that Associates the smoke effect on the trigeminal nerve and is Nick Tina element of smoke impact nicotine has an effect on that system yes is it the principal component that has an effect on the	 issue of the trigeminal nerve pathway	 if you mean in Smoke and smoke it is a major contributor I'd whether it's the principle or not I don't think I know anybody else know what are other contributors other than nicotine for instance if it's a mentholated cigarettes Menthol would would have an effect those chemicals within the families with aldehyde functionality would probably have have an effect	 how does nicotine contribute to this subjective aspects of smoking with respect smell there appear to be in the olfactory system	 which is the the olfactory nerve which is in your nose and then moves moves back to your brain specific cells and on those cells they have nerves that seem to respond to to nicotine	 is that work that was done by dr. golota that was work dr. glow to had done some of that work and others had for Mars have done some of the work as well that's correct who are you referring to are the doctor good doctor	 I forget his first name okay gloor has done done some work on the olfactory system in frogs and rats with regard to to nicotine and dr. Kirk COBOL who with an under and outside contract with Philip Morris has done some work I think in human human subjects	 is nicotine used as a flavoring agent but I felt worse objective form of the question how does how does nicotine's taste affect the subjective qualities of products that are sold by Philip Morris let's do you think tastes yes that's a question we would love to have the	 two	 in other words foot Mark doesn't know how nicotine impacts the subjective vis-ÌÊ-vis taste we are currently supporting research outside of Philip Morris to investigate those questions	 and when was that effort first commenced several years ago before you join the company	 I can't be sure	 Johnny might want to just choose an appropriate Breaking Point we've had lunch brought in for everybody	 this might actually be a good time why don't we do it now
