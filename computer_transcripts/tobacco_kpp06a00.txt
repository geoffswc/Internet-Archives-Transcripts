WTO caps and hr:140 contains comprehensive effective FDA regulation of tobacco that is not so radical that it would result in prohibition or other serious unintended consequences mr. chairman I am not here today to insist that it must be McIntyre Davis or nothing however I do believe that the only legislation containing the fundamental principles of hr:140 crafted in light of today's political and,look realities as a realistic possibility of an actin it seems to me that nobody can get everything that they want in this process and that only the bill that makes reasonable compromises can be signed into law we understand that there are complex and controversial issues in both parts of this legislation and we pledge to work with anyone who wishes to join in this challenge mr. chairman we commend you and your committee for these here, earrings as another critical step in the process thank you very much thank you mr. Smith take mr. Taylor welcome thank you good afternoon mr. chairman and members of the committee I'm Ashley Taylor and I serve as legal counsel to the Council of independent tobacco manufacturers of America a national trade Association better known as Sigma thank you for allowing me the opportunity to testify before you today sitting with consists of more than a dozen small tobacco, factors that have elected not to become signatories to the master settlement agreement between the major tobacco manufacturers and the State Attorneys General such as SM Rhea as non-signatories to the MSA sit members are required under state law enacted as part of the MSA to make certain escrow deposits based upon the number of sticks old and MSA States to become a citizen member a tobacco manufacturer must not only be duly authorized, used to conduct business in the United States but must also be in compliance with the state escrow obligations imposed pursuant to the MSA as well as other applicable state and federal laws governing tobacco manufacturers and the manufacturing process including but not limited to Federal and State Licensing and bonding requirements CDC ingredient reporting mandates and the Federal Trade Commission held label warnings Sigma was formed for a single purpose, to advocate for consistent treatment of all tobacco manufacturers Cinema was not formed for the purpose of obtaining any competitive advantage through the legislative process rather to ensure that when other manufacturers sought to do so a contrary voice would be heard articulating the inequity of their efforts unfortunately certain forces have sought to enact policies designed to place it in the members at a competitive disadvantage let me again re-emphasize, that's it mama is not opposed to legislation regulating the tobacco industry provided such measures are applied equally and not targeted solely Upon Our members because Sigma members are in many cases of former tobacco farmers and long-standing members of the local business Community they are sensitive to the plight of their local communities and the small tobacco Growers from whom they purchased their Leaf like the small tobacco farmer sit in the members must battle, all the same forces facing all small businesses in this uncertain and constantly changing tobacco industry sitting the members experiences as small business owners are often reflected in their business practices for example simply members more often than not have located their manufacturing facilities in economically depressed areas which are the same tobacco producing communities experiencing the loss of tobacco Farms their factories employee members of the local communities and are in many, is the best paying jobs in the local community sitting on members have facilities all over the country including factories in Arizona Florida New York North Carolina Tennessee Oregon Virginia Oklahoma South Carolina and Kentucky communities where such high-paying manufacturing jobs are important another member of certainly even has a facility in Miami with a Workforce that is more than 95 percent Hispanic, with regard to the formulation of tobacco quota by out legislation sitting a supports your efforts to provide assistance to Tobacco dependent communities particularly those comprised of small Family Farms sit in the further supports legislation that seeks to lend such assistance by making payments to Tobacco quota holders as compensation for the loss of the tobacco quota asset turning to the specific measures that must be addressed in any legislation certainly makes the following, observations first certainly supports the concept that the fund from which quarter holders would be paid would be created in part by assessments on manufacturers and importers who sell tobacco products and domestic Commerce in the United States with each class of tobacco product assigned a base payment however simply sit in the strongly urges this committee to consider a payment schedule based upon his company's volume of domestic sales rather than any proportion, Channel market share formula this latter approach is fraught with difficulties which would make such a collection system less effective than a straight volume-based calculation the system must be designed to make monetary collection workable over the life of the program this can be accomplished by tying the system to reports that manufacturers are currently required to make to the federal agencies and not creating a new reporting system which will needlessly add another level of bureaucracy, any form of buyout should be funded through the federal excise tax this is the only way to ensure collection of the money from employers and in any case any fee paid directly by manufacturers would simply be passed on to the consumer the fact that certain members elected not to join the MSA should not be misconstrued to suggest that our members are all new to the to the tobacco business, they sell a variety of products including smokeless tobacco roll-your-own and make your own product and of course cigarettes in some certainly members believe in the free market system and ask for no special favors or dispensation instead we only ask that rules apply with equal force to all tobacco manufacturers small and alike thank you again mr. chairman and members of the committee for allowing us to share our concerns with you this afternoon thank you mr. Taylor mr. Watson we're also pleased to have your testimony, mr. chairman my name is Steve Watson and vice president external Affairs for lorillard tobacco company based in Greensboro North Carolina and I appreciate the opportunity to discuss the issue over tobacco grow a buyout with this committee and to share some of our concerns warlock supports the buyout of the tobacco quota program however we see several major issues that must be resolved prior to the passage of any buyout bill first we supported by oath to preserve some type of Federal Supply Management program, second we oppose any bio paid for with federally imposed user fees excise taxes or assessments the third we are concerned that any proposed buyout payments May trigger a box trade problems that could affect major segments of the u.s. agricultural system the finally we oppose tying a buyout to FDA regulation in addition to needlessly complicate an already complex issue FDA regulation will threaten the viability of lorillard and those farmers who want to continue to grow tobacco, the proponents of a tobacco Court about have maintained that a buyout can be accomplished at eight dollars a pound for quarter owners and four dollars a pound for Growers at 1998 crop levels which would cost as much as 19 billion dollars 19 billion dollars in new taxes would have a disastrous effect on our business and ultimately on farmers will alert opposes any increase in the already substantial excise taxes to which cigarettes are subject and since 1998 the four major cigarette companies have paid over, hundred billion dollars to the federal and state governments including excise taxes sales taxes and MSA payments indeed 34 states have increased taxes on cigarettes in the last 15 months alone let me be clear in today's market lorillard May no longer be able to pass through these increased costs the price would be the loss of high-paying manufacturing jobs jobs that are unlikely to be replaced and our lost volume would be replaced by cigarettes containing virtually no domestic grown tobacco, as you may be aware of payments to Farmers as part of the buyout may qualify as a box payments under the WTO Provisions the bio payments were found to fall into the inbox category the a box caps would be exceeded turning across the board cuts and support programs for all Commodities including corn wheat soy and more even if you Str and USDA concluded that these payments are not a box payments other nations may disagree, this could lead to a trade action in a form in which the United States historically has not been particularly successful finally tobacco Growers are not being told that politically a buyout can only be accomplished by linking it to FDA regulation we oppose linking the two and believe that Growers are not being fully informed about the impact such legislation would have on farming practices and our ability to be a purchaser of domestic Leaf proponents of this legislation maintained that the agency will not be allowed on the farm and this is, simply not true this legislation would permit the FDA to regulate components of the tobacco components were not simply be limited to nicotine and tar the FDA would be authorized to regulate any substance in the leaf including those that occur naturally these bills do not take into account the cost of such changes or whether such changes are even technologically feasible the FDA must merely determine that a change has put appropriate for Public Health, with such extensive regulatory Authority the FDA could mandate changes to Growing practices or curing practices or even require genetic modification of tobacco seed that the FDA is not permitted on the farm then the burden would shift the manufacturing forcing us to become the de facto Regulators lorillard objects the being forced to play in such a role lastly all the provisions derived from the 19 1988 1988 legislation wouldn't it be nice if we could all go back to 1998 this would mean we're going back, billion dollars a year in federal excise taxes and almost 1 billion dollars a year in state excise taxes rolling back New York's increase in excise taxes from 64 cents to a pack to a current $3 per pack reversing smoking bans have been instituting places like California New York Florida Connecticut and elsewhere over 7,000 tobacco manufacturing jobs have been lost since 1998 yet no one is talking about the special subsidies for them going back to 1998 also means fewer counterfeit cigarettes less interstates, smuggling and a higher demand for domestically grown tobacco we understand the problems that the backhoe farmers face in this new environment but many of the bills pending before Congress failed to appreciate that all of us are living in that new environment manufacturers Farmers farm equipment suppliers warehouseman Leaf dealers and all employees as well they're all there are alternatives to a legislative buyout implementing the phase to trust fund and not require Congress to raise taxes or expand the regulatory power of the federal government We Believe, by out of a program could be accomplished without new taxes without FDA legislation by bringing all the interested parties to the table negotiated by out the adequately compensates Farmers we would welcome the opportunity to discuss this proposal with members of the committee thank you again for allowing me to share some of the views of lorillard tobacco committee and within this important policy debate be happy to answer any questions you may have thank you mr. Watson I'd like to start Those Questions by asking each and every one of you right down the line, line can your company or in a couple of cases companies afford to pay for a tobacco quota by out the various bills that we have seen before the Congress seem to arrange in a from about 14 billion to 19 billion dollars and that's going to entail payments of tens to hundreds of millions to perhaps of billions for some of your companies and we'll start with you mr., awesome we just like a brief answer on that question mr. chairman know we can't afford to pay for hundreds of millions of dollars in fact the Congressional research service take took a look at it and even under a very aggressive scenario that is where Leaf drops by 50 cents a pound it would take the tobacco manufacturers more than 55 years to offset what the Growers would be paid in five mr. mr. G, trophy mr. chairman in text it would be extremely difficult and maybe the better question is can the smoke or stay in paying for it because I assume that the cost would be paid through to the smoker but smoke has been hit from so many size Federal excise tax state excise tax cost of doing business I'm not sure how much more that can be passed through so it would be extremely difficult particularly for small companies that don't have a super premium product to absorb any further cost in the margins but again if we had to, we'd ask you to be equal as G that's a good observation that it will be passed through to the consumer but of course every consumer has their own price point and we'll move the lower cost tobacco out there it's going to affect different companies in different ways if it forces that consumer to make a change in in brand to go to a lower cost of tobacco when they hit their discomfort level in the price they're paying mr. Payne no mr. chairman mr. sharp mr. chairman and members, our Industries pipe and pipe tobacco and cigars cannot afford to pay nor should they have to pay for a program that they don't participate in as I said earlier in my testimony that the 165 million dollars a year that's being looked to for these industries May well exceed the net profit of those Industries after taxes this is semantic well I believe that if the cost of the program is reasonable and it's spread on a proportionate basis as a Level Playing Field for all participants, the marketplace that in fact it can be paid for by the price being absorbed by those who buy the product ultimately that's the only way it can be absorbed but that's I believe possible yes it's Taylor mr. chairman sit my as I mentioned this component is comprised of a small businesses and as with every small business their margins are very small they would be difficult but as a council we have taken the position that we support the vile provided our companies, are treated equally it's so long as it is not tied to in any way to the master settlement agreement payments and so long as it is not tied to the FDA I believe in your testimony you mentioned that you wanted it based on volume I take it that's dollar volume as opposed to numbers of cigarettes you want it on on the total receipt to the company rather than the port of a cigarette I'll charge but administrative ease mr. chairman it would be best for our companies if it were, on a strict volume that is stick count those are reports that we regularly make to the reporting agencies now and any payment could be linked to those same reports we currently submit our moisture companies lower cost in terms of what they charge for a cigarette I think it will be generally accurate to say they operate in the third and fourth tier but again they also produce chewing tobacco the Beechnut brand is owned by member of the council and they also produce a roll your own products as well, as make your own products I see thank you mr. Watson no sir Lord could not absorb more pass along the cost of a die out and not experience the direct impact in terms of volume sales loss that would certainly follow as a result of a buyout let me ask all of you to do the same thing with regard to your thoughts on the FDA regulation of tobacco products you think this could be done in such a way that, your company can can manage that regulation mr. chairman I think that certainly that would be possible although quite difficult which is yet another reason that it doesn't belong linked to the tobacco by out we heard from The Growers this morning about the urgency that they were facing I think that the complexity of FDA to come up with something that makes sense and and, and meets the needs of you know would just slow it down to the point where it would become overbearing mr. G for a smaller company your honor we don't have the margins to support what I assume even a reasonable FDA regulation would look like we don't have in-house scientists we don't have the information available to us that the other companies have we use u.s. tobacco we don't even use, tobacco so the natural ingredients and tobacco is what we have and what we use and I just don't see how small or maybe even medium and some larger companies could withstand FDA regulatory Authority if it's anything close to what we fear it may look like mr. Payne mr. chair mr. chairman looking at the reality of Hell type Bill might be sun and the law short answer is no we believe that it would irreparably harm our ability to compete for the business of adult smokers mr. Sharp, mr. chairman the FDA did not recommend that our industry be our Industries be managed regulated the proposed legislation the bills that have been introduced so far seem to realize this if we're in there were in a general sense I think there's a recognition of the complexity of the products involved that it would present unique challenges to the agency to try to manage to regulate our Ministries and for Industries to absorb the cost thank you mr. semantics, mr. chairman I think that's a difficult question for me to answer in the absence of specific regulations but we're having the same difficulty yeah but let me let me answer this way it seems to me that we have a product here that creates harm and society and then our objective needs to be to find ways to reduce harm and having looked into this in a great deal of detail my belief is that the only way we'll achieve that years, with some guidance from the FDA and FDA regulation we're already seeing issues occur in the marketplace as people attempt to approach this without appropriate guidance and so I do believe we needed and I believe that there are examples the food industry certainly the pharmaceutical industry where we have FDA regulation or we have large companies regulated small companies regulated they seem to find their way they seem to be successful regardless of their size so a lot of it comes down to let's make sure, have appropriate regulation for this category in for these products I do believe we need it I do believe we need to do it and I do believe we can do it we just need to do it the right way well given the fact that there are an awful lot of folks out there who believe that this product is harmful and even should be banned what is the risk that that is indeed going to be the regulation that it is either an outright ban or so onerous that you cannot comply with the regulations, that are offered well I think the the prohibition the Banning of the product is is the right Society has I don't believe at this point in time Society wishes to ban the use of tobacco but society and I you can Congress needs to retain the right to make that decision not give it to the FDA and at some point in the future Congress determines that's appropriate thing Congress can can go ahead and do that so I wouldn't agree, that that's an appropriate direction to give to the FDA at this point because Society has an indicated that that's what they want to have you you indicate a you I'm sure heard the testimony of the last panel there were some division amongst the producers as to whether or not they would like FDA regulation but they were all they were unanimous in warning that FDA regulation kept off the farm do you believe that is accomplishable given the fact that, whatever regulations are imposed upon the company's they're going to be tremendous incentive with the kind of contract buying that is developing and I expect we'll continue to Future to contractually require those regulation to be passed on down to the farmer right well I think there are two parts to things I think that answer that question one of them is today already we have issues that come up and and they necessitate us going to our grow, was and helping them make changes in their growing process I think the currents is over the last couple of years related to flue-cured tobacco and the curing process being determined to create TSN days and tobacco and ultimately Philip Morris and and the tobacco leadership determining that we needed to find and help The Growers convert their bonds to remove that and a as a result of done that and have had a over 90% reduction in tssaa, a sand flea Cube tobacco in this country is an example of those things occurring without FDA so I think that happens in the normal course of doing business one way or the other this the buyer has to dictate the specifications that they need in order to be successful in the marketplace to the supplier that just happens across the board not just with Growers to beyond that I think you know virtually every crop that it at least ultimately is consumed that this committee has responsibility for, one ultimately is regulated by the FDA I believe that's correct not on the farm but through the manufacturer and we seem to manage we seem to be able to do that in general I find people to be at the end of the day pretty sensible and responsible about these things so we ought to be able to work our way through that I think in tobacco just the way it gets worked through in food thank you mr. Taylor mr. Watson diverge a little bit there but please, he's address the question might have deregulation and include the matters that I mentioned mr. semantic weather with regard to getting it on the farm well as Sigma looks forward and tries to anticipate the regulations which would ultimately be promulgated by the FDA once the statute has extended the fda's authority in this area we have a difficult time envisioning any regulation that does not set the burden so high that our members, simply could not comply we are again small companies and in the regulatory process our voices is very small and we fear that the burden again that would be set would be such that we simply could not comply over time that is that is something we're very concerned about and we do work closely with the farmers our members do and we see a lot of information and the relationship between the farmers and the manufacturers, reflected in the contracts and ultimately we believe most manufacturers would operate pursuant to those contracts put in some work on connect the to thank you and finally mr. Watson this the short answer mr. chairman is when you look at the FDA debate the problem is there is no uniformed answer as to what is reasonable and what is appropriate you will hear and later panel today what their definition public health communities, in addition of of FDA regulation might be which is much different than that of what mr. semantics position of reasonable FDA ought to be which is different from my companies and then we've already heard from the farm groups today they want the money and they don't really know about FDA the the short of it how I like to look at the the FDA and whether or not it would be allowed on the farmer needs to be on the farm is is when you look at a cigarette the major problem that those proponents of FDA have with a cigarette is it's not, the paper and it's not the filter it's the tobacco and unless you're able to get into the tobacco and particularly those things that occur naturally within the tobacco leaf that's not going to achieve what the goal is of that of an FDA regime so that's what the how we really see how this debate is an unfolding by thank you all the gentleman from Texas mr. stenholm listening to the first panel a little listening to this panel, we will be suddenly looks more achievable in our consumption being developed by this committee that's the pessimistic view take the optimistic view with any over the past three years Customs data shows that the value of U s-- tobacco leaf exports has averaged about three dollars and seven cents per pound at the export terminals over the same time the value of debacle a leaf Imports has averaged about a dollar twenty three this suggests the cost of, imported tobacco for manufacturers is about 40% of the cost of domestic tobacco in this country is this an accurate analysis from the custom data based on your experience as buyers of both domestic and imported tobacco yes it is, it's about yes yes it was asleep is higher priced generally been then off shore leave yes it also suggested whoever's buying are exported tobacco is willing to pay 40% more for it, the correct one impact of a buyout would presumably be lower prices for domestic leaf, what savings on a per pound or per pack basis to you expect to see and how does that compare to the current per pound and per pack cost to you of domestic tobacco leaf, Mustaine home I think I missed Austin's testimony earlier Congressional research service took a look at that made an assumption that you would have 50 cents per pound saving as a result of price decrease domestically compare that to a 15 and 19 billion dollar cost of a buyout and anticipated that it would take 55 years to recover that cost we do not believe based just on our preliminary look at what potential savings per pound would be, availability of other sources of tobacco as you mentioned on imported basis versus the calls that we would realize any savings off this certainly not in the immediate future but it would be very very long term and if you were looking at it from an Roi return on investment standpoint as a small business person it probably would fall well outside your parameters of when you would want that money that return back to your back to your pocket, this is what gets a little bit troubling for me we've had these same discussions with sugar with peanuts with all Commodities and there seems to be a desire and I understand this you've got to meet the competition the question is who is the competition and is the competition fair and if you're going to lower the price to domestic producers then you, boom somebody benefits from that mr. Boehner is interested in the consumer benefiting from that and I understand that rationale but you know the buyout we've got several problems with the battery out anticipation one is who's going to pay for it how much is it going to cost under what basis and there are some expectations that are out there that are going to be rather difficult to achieve from a grower standpoint based on who's going to pay, say the flip side to this I mean the FDA question that the chairman was talking about is going to be one that's going to have to be rationalized also if you're going to Mcintyre bill is going to have to be reconciled sooner or later then you come there's been a tendency of most of you at the table to say you're interested in a buyout but how much and who pays and it is it fair and some of you contend that it's not fair to pay in a buyout when you're not part of the problem, much kind of makes sense but I guess, simple question that it doesn't have to be answered right now because my time is out but it seems to me that a buyout is going to be necessary for us to achieve what all of you say you want to achieve in the furtherance of your industry a buyout is going to be required the question then becomes how much and how we evolved into who's going to pay for it and ultimately the consumer will pay for it so those are the three and then the expectation that many in the, losing side is once we've had to buy out there will still be a tobacco program that will still be regulating the price which is going to be part of that world peace equation that I'm having a difficult time sorting through so not a specific question for any of your other than appreciate the answer to you've already given the testimony but if if there is to be a buyout we're going to have to get a little better consensus than what we've got at the table right now and how, It ultimately will affect your customers and I wished I had a better question for your answer well thank you mr. chairman and let me just start by welcoming back to this room knows someone who's to sit over at that committee table the staff table over there mr. Payne who is once a staffer in this room for those do the sitting at the staff table the you two could grow up and have, real job thank you Congressman you'll have to excuse me for stepping out of the room but I happen to be one of your customers and, accepted I found out the where I was smoking is where the health groups are I was wondering why they were looking at me funny in the back the health groups have seemed to be back there so I decided I better come back to the committee room you know without without without the customer the grower isn't growing tobacco, and what about the customer those of you that are manufacturers there, you don't have anything to manufacture and without the customer there's no distributor there's no convenience stores since most of their revenue comes from selling tobacco products and and as I look at what, has happened over the last half dozen years you all signed a consent agreement consent agreements and paid for by the customer the states and the federal government been jacking up excise taxes sticking it to the customer and I just want to know from any one of you down there if any of you believe that if there's a to buy tobacco buyout program that, summer is going to get stuck with a bill once again, well can I comment on that Congressman so either they're going to get stuck with they're not well I think that the consumer will in fact not Market forces will prevail in this but I think at the end of the day if it's a Level Playing Field charge that ultimately at least a portion of it if not all of it will wind up with the consumer but having said that one of the reasons why we've taken the position to support HR, 40 piece of legislation that includes a buyout and FDA regulation is because part of that money goes to fund FDA regulation we believe that all the reasons that you described for the consumer having a lot of pressure put on them today higher prices higher taxes MSA payments all of those things related back right back to the issue that tobacco causes harm well in lots of people are trying to do things to correct that and perhaps, perhaps if we could reduce some of the harm through effective FDA regulation the consumer would get a real benefit and we wouldn't have all these ad hoc efforts going on trying to charge higher prices to keep smoking and so on that were I was trying to avoid getting into the FDA issue because most people in this room that I've talked to about it realize that there's no way to control the FDA and there's no way a bill, tobacco by op Bills ever going to get passed without FDA regulation and FDA regulation is going to lead to who knows what except the customer is going to pay the price no ifs ands or buts about it in an earlier panel I step back try to take them the big picture look at the circular firing squad that's going on in the industry amongst the players and, the person stuck in the middle of the customer because he's the guy paying the price we talked about the higher prices we've got a government policy State policies City policies now all aimed at trying to end the use of tobacco while at the same time of those of us on this committee are trying to find a way to keep tobacco farmers in business people are going to smoke, we all know that there's no smoke and we keep imposing new regulations new taxes all we're going to do is raise the price of cigarettes and what's going to happen going to increase smuggling we're going to have more imported sticks that don't carry any of the MSA prices and at some point I think we as a government and you as an industry are going to have to sit down and make a logical determination about how we stop, the circular firing squad and I'm not sure that the proposals that we have before us will do anything other than raise the cost of manufacture the cost of production the cost of manufacture and in the end Stick it to the customer one more time but I appreciate all of you being here mr. Germany of might want to put me down as undecided on this Bill thank you mr. Boehner and before	 I recognize the gentleman from North Carolina I might point out that mr. Boehner may be directing some of his comments to me with respect to cost because I'm not really a smoker but I do occasionally they smoke other people's brand are you are a smoker you're just not a purchaser or is that would refer to what a customer the gentleman from North Carolina is recognized	 thank you thank you mr. chairman mr. says mansukh and your testimony before the subcommittee on specialty crops last fall you alluded to the fact that having a price support or Supply control system still in place after a bio would violate our WTO obligations could you please elaborate on that point for us now and more importantly explain to this committee how about might affect other crops in terms of our international trade agreements while	 I'll do my best I'm not an expert on this but we certainly have reviewed this with some people with expertise and I think that critical here is that any type of buyout that goes forward has to stop at a buyout has to pay for an asset which is what's proposed in hr:140 it's to pay for an asset and then you can't continue to have quotas or subsidies	 supports after the fact because if you do that my understanding is it takes what would be otherwise in the green box of payment for the asset and brings it along with everything else over into the Amber box and once in the a box of course it gets counted with everything else and if you hit the cap which is my it's my understanding we increasingly push up toward it and there's some talk about lowering the cap you all of a sudden trigger	 reductions in payments to Growers of corn and soybeans and other crops and so I think that's what the issue is it's not that we can't do a buyout but I think the buyout has to be truly a buyout and then stop at that point and not go on to provide subsidies there is an issue that's discussed which is a safety net after a buyout but a safety net can't be in the form of something that is a license or controls production or	 is a price Support Program because my understanding is that that would put it into the a box thank you and of course that gives them the issue of foreign competition and how much domestic or American Tobacco we were really using our products on mr. Payne at last September's hearing that we had in this room you are not able to specify what percentage of American Tobacco is used in your Brand's stated you would give us an answer the record remained open for 10 days but I don't find a supplemental answer can you tell us now what percentage your company uses if	 to exclude Oriental tobacco which is not available in the u.s. we do use a majority of American Leaf in our blend I have to tell you that one of the implications of potentially adopting a buyout and the competitive situation is as I look at competitors at this table I have one immediately to my right which is the low end that can sell a carton of cigarettes fifteen dollars cheaper for a carton and RJ are can and then to my left is	 Market dominant player in the sense of Philip Morris USA is when the Great competitors of world and have about 50% of US market and that's an element that we would have to take a very hard look at terms of calls from quality as to what that specific percentage would be okay but right now it's over 50% if you exclude Oreo Oriental it does constitute a majority of our students all right and one other follow-up at that hearing you were also asked to submit to the committee to specific types of FDA regulation that you	 you would support you've outlined again today the type that you would not support that information according to the Chairman's directive was to been submitted within 30 days on apparently do not see that in the committee's report could you now tell us what FDA regulations you would support well as I said at the subcommittee hearings say again today we have long held long had on our website available for anyone to see 24 hours a day 7 days a week basically the eight components of what we believe	 a reasonable FDA regulation our standard is at the end of the day regardless of what agency has would have the authority would we still be able to effectively compete for the business of adult smokers what I mean by that is could we retain our camel smokers talk to a bayley smoke or a Marlboro smoker about trying one of our products and involves good manufacturing practices it involves standardization of tar and nicotine levels and descriptors on the pack reduce risk	 standards keeping the not note expansion of the marketing and advertising restrictions Beyond what's Incorporated in the MSA and currently enforced by over 46 States all right would you be willing to address that and submit it to the committee as requested last form of course of course but it's also on www.drdino.com that you can go to it anytime right I understand that and you said that last fall but the committee requested you put it in writing and submitted within 30 days in re willing to comply	 was that true okay thank you very much mr. chairman no further question I recognized myself messenger Szymanski I would like to follow up a little bit with the discussion between you and the chairman with respect to the possibility that FDA could end time provide for a ban on tobacco products How likely do you think that is	 in the future	 well I suppose it's as likely as as as being here today is no it's just it's as likely as the members giving it permission to do that I mean ultimately Congress reserves the right for those things itself and currently the FDA doesn't have that Authority and you know FDA hasn't generally been given unfettered authority over products that it regulates its given Direction	 by Congress and the House of Representatives and the Senate and in the actual legislation that's passed and so we don't support legislation that would give the authority to the FDA to prohibit the sale of tobacco we think the fda's mission should be to reduce harm caused by tobacco not make the decision whether or not it should be sold that should be left to Congress if this the will of the people at some point in time is that tobacco should be sold then so	 be it I think Congress will have to make that decision but that's not the case today and so I don't think that Authority should be granted to the FDA today well then we get into a definition of what the will of the people is I agree with mr. Boehner I believe that they're going to their people who are going to continue to smoke but if it's a possibility that tobacco is going to be banned you can't sell it people can't smoke it does that ban extend to a situation where where I couldn't even grow too	 come on my farm and couldn't even roll it or chew it or use it in any way that I could is that is that a possibility	 not unless the Congress gives the FDA vat Authority so I and I don't think that'll pass I don't think people are going to be willing to give the FDA that Authority nor would I suggest that we do that I thought if people fear that that's the realistic Prospect then shouldn't Congress withhold all authority from the FDA to regulate this product I would hope that what we need to be able to do is work through a process that would get us to reasonable regulation in the house	 and in the Senate because I think that consumers do want harm reduced that's caused by tobacco they do want FDA regulation they just don't want the product to be banned and so I think that's the kind of legislation that needs to be passed all right thank you very much let me ask somebody on this panel I don't think we have I don't think we've discussed the in week discuss the price of a	 a package of cigarettes and we've discussed how much of that price is tax but nobody at least out of not remember anybody telling us how much of the price of a pack of cigarettes goes to the farmer to pay for the tobacco that's in a pack of cigarettes can any of you Miss Dawson can you tell us that I don't remember alright so now I mr. G	 I don't know you're on a bit as a farmer family I'd say not enough all right mr. Payne I don't know the exact percentage but as you look at it beyond what the government takes what the manufacturers cost is and then the manufacturer makes wholesaler or retailer there's no question that the tobacco farmer and I don't mean to quote a holder I mean the actual form puts your money at risk to produce the product is on the low end of that totem pole	 if for no other reason they're paying fairly enormous rent and lease rates in order to have to write how far down on the totem pole is it do you have any ideas it on the bottom row as compared to government this way that I mean we basically estimate we make about 12 cents a pack and so again it would certainly be less net and I assume it would be some amount less than a penny of that I'm sorry sir I didn't assume it would be an amount less than a penny of attack all right and Emma	 the cigarette sale for average price National last year was right at $3.57 a pact right in that 350 range and the farmer gets one sing thank you mr. Bain I appreciate that let me go now to the gentleman from North Carolina mr. Hayes I'm going for gentleman from North Carolina here we have get representation well I appreciate these 10 names and gentlemen	 we've got three left anyway I appreciate the chairman holding this hearing and appreciate you all being here and we'll have any questions this time	 all right now we go to mr. Etheridge thank you mr. chairman let me thank you all of you for being here today I sort of find myself a lot like the ranking member that you know I don't think any of us would ever thought 56 years ago we'd be seated here today talking about this issue certainly not the farmers who were here earlier today I think certainly not any of you in on the production side and probably	 to help boost that we were here later probably will block them in here with their not to would be here and I think we're here for a variety of reasons and having heard from the farmers earlier I think one of the real issues that we're facing is the crisis is not just in the dibakar community because the practice of Agriculture all across America the tremendous pressures they're feeling so I thank you for being here let me	 it's meant to ask you the first question and I'll try to cover the others because I my time is limited according your testimony in the comments you made a few moments to go as a relates hr:140 sort of sense if you feel that has the best chance of passing from what I heard State however I must confess and having having the benefit of reading to help to testimony beforehand	 they indicate almost to the person that they're opposed to that piece of legislation because of the some of the provisions FDA in it I guess my question is do you really believe we'll be able to pass a piece of legislation that healthgroup aren't on board with in some way	 given that deer and this committee most of us Todd wanted one way or another tag people but we care bill to the floor we got to have a lot of other things so it's a broader issue you want to comment on that yes I will why I suppose the real answer to that is it remains to be seen but as I said in my oral comments that I think this is a matter of compromise and nobody's going to get everything that they want fine	 I think if you look at the provisions of FDA that are in hr:140 what you'll find is that they're very similar in nature to the Kennedy to Wine filled with with a few exceptions one of them is the one we've talked in it Kennedy wind does not expressly prohibit the FDA from Banning tobacco products there's a consumer acceptability clause in McIntyre Davis that doesn't exist in	 in the Kennedy wine they'll there is preemption in the in the McIntyre Davis Bill that doesn't exist in the Kennedy the line bill but when you come down to ingredients you come down to one ting labels you come down first and standards for products you come you come to Provisions for introducing new products and handling reduced risk or purported to be reduced risk or reduced exposure products these bills are very similar in that regard so	 in actuality when you look at them they're closer together than they are far apart there are more things that are alike than different and I think there ought to be the ability to come together and find something we can we can get past thank you let me cover one more point with you then I'll move on you didn't kick in your written testimony and combined earlier related to some kind of program afterwards that you didn't think we should really do that provide security for years to come because the earnings that they would get from a buyout to help	 the cover that but I'm sure you heard from some of the farmers who were here this morning which I think pretty representative of a lot of farmers and probably they would more representative than some of the farmers who out there struggling because most of these pretty good-sized farmers and they talk about eating up the equity to death for piling up yeah I think Farmers really do have some serious problem and it's not unique as I said earlier to these folks and I think the greatest fear I stand from Farmers is	 as unsecured as they are for they are they really unsure of the future that they don't know what it's going to be and my question to you and to all our viewers a assuming we can get about let's assume they were fortunate and yet one	 whether there is a program afterwards that hold something in place to give some kind of security or safety net whether it be permanent or a phase out if that be the case can you support that I get online ask yes or no can you support first of all a permanent or a one that would phase out will be the same question	 well you know it depends what it is but obviously but I think it might comment what what I said was that I believe that some elements of safety net are likely going to be necessary here but they need to be elements that don't trigger WTO caps and put this money into the a lock so we've real man so you got things like there are some built-in for example	 first and foremost I think in hr:140 the money being paid up front eight dollars and four dollars particularly on the user to involve his a safety net because it gives them the cash in hand but beyond that it does have Geographic restrictions in it which which I think would help it does have crop insurance it does have this notion of a tobacco quality board that would help Growers take their product to the international markets and I have heard recently that in the	 there's some discussion of a private insurance program which wouldn't be an issue relative to WTO caps but would provide a protection if prices fell below a certain level and that that would be funded by manufacturers and Growers kind of on a 50-50 basis I think it's a relatively low cost and and while I've not seen the details on that that sounds like something that might be an appropriate site safety net as well so	 I think the possibility exists to do this you know we've committed as a part of selling a piece of litigation to we made a long-term tenure commitment to buy the majority of our tobacco from domestic rollers so we we feel like there's a number of things here that want to safety net that don't have to trigger WTO caps and there's a way to do it it just has to be done the right way it's terribly I realized about time is running out but I would like to	 yes or no from both your taking yoga	 oh Carson as I testified in my written testimony and also its subcommittees just it's not RG our position that we believe that the price poor program should be abolished I can just say Congressman growing up in a small community where we had a scoble plan in a button factory in a zipper Factory and a belt Leggett department store in a hard way or all in one town and they're all gone now without something on the other end it's going to take tobacco away in Myer Virginia is very hilly and rich soil	 most beautiful old belt back of it if you go pure capitalism is going to be devastating because it's going to go to areas more than about a huge corporate farming and you don't kill our community Congressman it would depend on what the details were	 anybody else this mr. Taylor mr. Watson did you wish the government yes for Sigma members the majority of which purchased almost 90% of the backhoe produced here it is important that whatever program that is also adopted provide some stability for the local community so if there is a phase out going back to what mr. G said it's important that there be an element of stability for the community since we rely on that local community	 Congressman I've never completely understood why the conventional wisdom seems to be that it must be through the United States Congress that you pass a 19 billion dollar tax increase in order to achieve a buyout our position has been as that we can achieve this similar in a way which we negotiate the phase 2 payments of five point one five billion back in the late 1990s that said most people have said well we can't do that because you'll never get Philip Morris to the table and that may be true but I would certainly hope and think that	 be this committee would encourage all those people who participated and need to participate in a bio manufacturers Farm leadership the tourney States attorney's generals to get together and come to the table we've seen in the past that when we do get all the members to the table while it may not be perfectly everybody may not get exactly what they were looking for the end of the day we can get something done and the hopes and Prospects of modernized in a system that will lower the price of tobacco make us tobacco	 Ramesh is going to become more competitive around the world which will allow us to buy more tobacco is in the best interest of everyone concerned now the question is whether that is politically feasible and when it's politically advantageous to link a regulatory proposal for which there is no General agreement on helps for actually complicates the buyout proposal I think if we're fast forward six months from now and we're still scratching our heads as to why possibly a buyout has not been accomplished and one more	 have Contracting one more year of purchase intentions has to go through while at the same time our farmers are back home suffering I think we have to look at this FDA issue and maybe think about studying think the mouth I'm gonna slam was expired the gentleman from Florida mr. Putnam language Gemini mr. sharp I'll be happy to yield the gentleman from North Carolina told him it was just yesterday that since we don't participate in the price Support Program where neutral well that that's a	 it's a nice segue I've noticed you've been pretty quiet I grow Citrus in in my part of the State of Florida and and that's why it's important to these folks who have such a big growing area have all the time they need to to get into the ins and outs of this if we could find a way to roll and smoke some kind of a some piece of the product stream of citrus I think we'd do it if it would add value to our farm gate receipts the we hadn't figured out how to do it yet but my new District	 go to the edge of Ybor City and we've got a little interest in the cigar industry and and I'm curious how much American Quarter tobacco goes into the cigars car showing the entire cigar industry uses around 40 million pounds of tobacco a year no more than 40 million pounds compared to about 700 million pounds for cigarettes the vast majority of our tobacco is imported there's a	 difference between cigarette type tobacco and cigars tobacco and you'll find that there is some domestic cigar Tobacco For example the Connecticut wrapper and binder that is used in cigars but in terms of quota Tech tobacco there's very very little there might be I believe there's one small manufacturer in Pennsylvania that uses some fire occurred tobacco and there may be some other imported quota type tobacco used in a minor segment of the popular price cigars but overwhelmingly it's a cigar	 tobacco not cigarette type tobacco is the USDA even have a reporting requirement for your quota grown tobacco no there is no quota growing tobacco for cigars in the United States for cigar type tobacco well I guess I would ask what role do you see the cigar industry playing in a buyout of quota holders if you're not buying any quota tobacco well	 going the question I would ask also what mr. Taylor earlier you mentioned when we're trying to get to sort of sort of the driving core policies behind whatever program may end up he said one of the things was to treat we need to treat companies equally measured by volume and you referred to stick count where would the cigar or pipe pipe tobacco fall into a formula for something like that if they're not buying	 American poet Ibaka I don't know the answer to that question most of our members and as I sit here today I can't think of a single member of Sigma that manufactures a cigar for those who are on the panel assume some of you probably have Cigar divisions within your cigarette Manufacturing Company do you see a role for cigars in a quarter by out if they're not buying any quarter tobacco	 can I answer that kind of shot you might I don't know that it's so much cigars as it is that I think the idea here is that we offshore tobacco is what's displacing the American Growers ability to make a living and we have lots and lots of cigarettes coming into this country today that are manufactured offshore with tobacco that are it's glowing somewhere else in the world and it's displacing the sales of products	 use u.s. growing tobacco I think from a payment point of view the idea is that this is a user fee for the purpose of using the market and cigars use the market I think it's fair to argue that it's a little less of an issue for them but the issue does remain that if you get price disparities between these products that causes consumption shifts between them because of those disparities that	 that that continues the problem so the idea is this is about using the market and it's about the fact that you're displacing u.s. grown tobacco with foreign growing tobacco most of which is in cigarettes but but certainly some of its and cigars the purpose really is the is to take care of the farmers though it while you put the idea is to if you funded it purely on the basis of people who are using us grown tobacco you'd simply raise those prices you would cause	 the demand for us grown tobacco to go down even more and exacerbate the problem either even further that's why it has to be spread and and and the people that are in fact chewing up some of the farmers business the folks that are using products with off share offshore tobacco have to pay their fair share	 well I'm not sure if I totally follow that that line of reasoning I see that my time is expired but I do have concerns about asking a group that's not participating in our current	 government price support system my current government quota system to Bear the burden of the of the buyout so I look forward to learning more about that mr. chairman I appreciate your Indulgence the gentleman from Georgia mr. Marshall is recognized	 thank you mr. chairman come from Middle Georgia and my district there are 236 quota Farmers 9.8 million pounds this year and and then also BMW with 2100 good job than so I've got an interesting perspective on all of this I guess I should add that mr. G was a student at Mercer law school while I was a professor there I think he was both Lucky and and showed good judgment lucky that he didn't get me his	 Geo and then showed good judgment not to take me in his as I never had an opportunity to ask questions of mr. Jin lost going to tempted to just focus on him and I just announced that it does trouble me that there is a competitive advantage that smaller producers manufacturers have not being part of the master settlement agreement and anything that we structure here it seems to me that perhaps a disproportionate share of the cost of the buyout needs to be borne by	 you guys in order to sort of level the prank that the playing field the competitive playing field but I do have some questions for Philip Morris what I understand is that the other companies think that FDA regulation is going to put them out of business or at least really hurt him a lot and yet you your company is advocating FDA regulation and I'm wondering why it is that Philip Morris and I'd like you to be specific and responding if you would why Philip Morris thinks	 it's going to Survive and Thrive and do well in comparison with these other companies that are really kind of worried about what this proposed FDA regulations going to do to their business	 well Congress and I suppose I could take the position that I'm worried and I think we've had some discussion here today about certainly if the FDA regulation the gun act it allowed the FDA to prohibit the product or things like that I guess I'd be really worried and sorry that I asked for it but I do think that it's very plausible to have FDA regulation that we can all live with we had regulation in the food business and I talked about that a bit earlier and more small companies and large companies	 all of which participating Food business and the regulated by the FDA come and have a very limited amount of time here so I'm going to understand that's the official position here seems to me that you all must be on the verge of manufacturing a cigarette that you think the FDA will be happier with that than it would be with the other brands how close are you to producing a cigarette that's in that you could perhaps persuade the FDA is safer than then cigarettes that we have today	 I don't know that I have a cigarette that I can persuade the FDA is safer II do have technology that we've been working on that at least at this stage would indicate it reduces exposure in human consumption to a list of various toxins that are in cigarette smoke whether or not that translates to disease reduction is another matter and it's one of the reasons why we've been reluctant with this technology to move	 had we're we deleted the FDA will have to provide guidance for us and others now some companies in fact have already gone forward with similar products Prana Williamson as one of them and has it in the marketplace I believe they have yes Mark have you copyrighted your technology and trade market or have you patented part of me the the technology that you're referring to I'm not sure that I'm not sure that I think there's some elements and maybe	 and I'm not sure it is this technology that so is this technology that you're going to share with the other companies I'm going to put it openly in the market one day so they'll see it do you mean am I going to give it out to other companies now I wouldn't I wouldn't be able to give away property my company and a mic one of the concerns that the other companies have is that the proposed limitations on marketing essentially will freeze the status quo of the big guy stay big the small what's your response to that	 I'm sorry I didn't hear all the cars limitations on marketing white Marlboros got a brand-name recognition at this point you dramatically limit marketing Marlboros name brand recognition stays High others can't really make inroads as a result of your sheer size is that part of the strategy well the hr:140 proposes to kind of pry the MSA those regulations are already in place and we're already operating with them and that that really is the predominant marketing restriction in that bill	 I guess I have a question for Miss Dawson Miss Dawson how would you modify the bill that you have a response to this if you don't perhaps you can provide it in writing how would you modify the FDA regulation for it part of this bill to eliminate what you perceive to be a competitive disadvantage for both Brown & Williamson and a lot of these other companies Visa video bullet marks it would be easier to start rewriting a different bill that would be to modify the current bill	 because what you see with whether it's for the 140 or the other bills that have been proposed they take the Food and Drug model medical device model try to jam tobacco products in and we don't make a safe product or products are dangerous there yet they're trying to be regulated towards safety and so the disconnect is this huge and Miss Dawson and a miss chairman math just a couple more questions that I'm supposed to thank you sir I'm sorry I just had a limited	 amount of time here so you do think that you could write something even if you start it from scratch that would provide for governmental regulation FDA regulation which mr. Bonner says is going to be a precondition to getting anything done but you think would level the playing field or at least not cause such a disruption in the playing field is what this proposal it would depend on what what one wants to accomplish through additional regulation well if it's ingredient disclosure if it's youth smoking if it's	 I'm gonna plant inspections you know you really need to put an agenda on the table and then start to figure out whether you'd be interested in what suggestions you have along those lines because we seem to be heading in this direction and you might as well have a voice at the table one last question would Phillip Morris be willing to go with the buyout but no ft regular FDA regulation separate two issues use for the buyout I support the buyout in the context of FDA regulation congressman	 regulation is a key objective for us we believe that that's necessary and appropriate and we also don't think that we will get either one buyout or regulation unless they're put together thank you mr. chairman thank you the gentleman from Michigan mr. Smith is recognized as chairman thank you what's the quality of us grown tobacco compared to other parts of the world very high it's very good it's very high what what	 what percentage of imported tobacco would you normally blend is it a question of blending it with most production of cigarettes for example well it depends on the cigarette and our cigarettes we generally carry about 80% content of u.s. grown tobacco and then part of the blind would include some Oriental tobacco and but our cigarettes are predominantly u.s. prone to that would happen to your production if there was 0	 tobacco grown in the United States we would buy tobacco in other places in the world what would happen to the size of your your production would it would it go down 10% 20% or stay about the same well I wouldn't anticipate it would go down I think that you just buy tobacco from an alternative Source in modeling or tobacco would be grown in other places in the world mr. sharp on cigars	 that true is it is a perception or is it real that that the Dominican Republic cigar or the Cuban cigars a better cigar I think that Cuba has very good soil and climate conditions for making cigars but the quality of the cigar is very inconsistent the quality of the cigar come to the Dominican Republic is very good I look forward to some day when there's availability of Cuban tobacco the fit into	 Brands but I don't think it's purely subjective right now what would what's happening in terms of research in Cuba when I visited Cuba they have a blight infection problem with their tobacco that the scientists said could be cured with a genetically modified tobacco that they already have developed a democracy but they don't want to implement it because they're afraid of you and lose	 some of their European market would that be true with the production in the United States that there's going to be you're going to avoid any genetically modified tobacco products has let me there there is a tobacco company that's not present on the panel today that has attempted to use genetically modified tobacco leaf I believe that they've	 now discontinued that I think it raises a good question as it relates to again given more authority of the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration may have let's assume that they have fairly broad Authority and designed to enact or adopt proposals they deemed beneficial to the public health obviously nicotine is an issue that's long been talked about and so one immediate way of dealing with the levels of nicotine in the actual production of the leaf would be	 go to GMO type to back and it is possible that that might be a recommendation in fact an action from Commissioner of FDA with broad regulatory Authority use those is research ongoing now I mean I chair the research Committee in science and we have the wherewithal scientifically to develop to take the jeans and	 fold in the proteins in such a way that they can do a lot of things that I suspect the potential is very real to develop the kind of pocket tobacco to lower the tires and nicotine's would maybe go through some of the companies if that was their would you would you buy that tobacco from your Growers Congressman there's a Genome Project going on it I believe it's North Carolina State University	 building the GM of of the tobacco plant and there may be potential down the road to use genetic modification as a form of harm reduction there are issues with that that will have to be taken care of there are issues relative to products manufactured here that are exported to Europe where genetic modification and some of those countries isn't	 doesn't meet their regulatory requirements so some thought has to be put to how you get all these kinds of things done but there is research going on there some potential does exist in the last 30 years how much of our tobacco cigarette and cigar and chewing production has moved offshore you need some guesses production offshore yes the last 30 years we've lost half of our production in the last 30 years or plus somebody's castling	 well in terms of our production for domestic use here we lost any other we've been the last 30 years we haven't lost so there are time I might company my company hasn't removed any production are u.s. Kyle and Jessi on total the loss of some businesses that have gone out of business and some manufacturers that have gone out of business just trying to get a feel of how much we've lost imported cigarette products manufactured offshore are growing in this country and they've begun to grow	 in the last few years primarily due to great price disparities between the cost of products manufactured here and the cost of those products where they're manufactured any other comments from any of the other Witnesses well cigarette volumes in the United States have been going down between 1 and 2% a year for four decades going back to the first surgeon general's report what that means and in terms of production I haven't seen Quantified	 my company's lost jobs and union jobs sales jobs and those sorts of things as our volumes have been hit am I corrected overall World consumption has been going up is that joint is that correct	 I see some heads nodding back of your so I assumed it was but I want to respond to the question on cigars I want to find a good domestic Sakai like cigar with a little Brandy so that's what I'm so looking for are going to make all these trips to other countries well you'll find that the cigar industry the Volume last year sales volume the United States was about 58 percent of what it was 30 years ago the most of the cigars the vast majority of cigar	 made overseas are the premium had made cigars most of the cigars made in the United States of the popular price machine-made cigars thank you mr. chairman thank you gentleman from Kentucky mr. Lucas thank you mr. chairman I was somewhat enlightening and encouraged by our Growers panel this morning I'm somewhat conflicted by what we have here in a given the fact that people like me from	 tobacco producing states and others in the room here from the southeast it's a given that we want to have a program for tobacco Farmers but it seems like to me everybody's holding pretty steadfast so their positions as it comes to FDA which is a Bugaboo and I'm a little discouraged that we don't seem to have made a lot of progress here other than people	 stating their positions and other than mr. sharp who tend to agree with his dilemma that I would be interested in hearing from someone you know a lot of times up here that it seems to me that the way we get things done is when everybody's just a little bit unhappy about the settlement we come up with and I would estimate before	 an open mic session here to see if anyone sees any breakthrough that I'm not seeing as far as the company's positions and it gets in regard I think it seems to me most everything else can be worked out except the FDA problem is there any Common Ground here does anyone offer me any Ray of Hope or optimism about what you agree with about FDA and there's plenty of disagreement with anyone you want	 shot at a Dawson I'm happy to take the first shot at it on FDA I think that's a non-starter so I'm not I'm not optimistic on that if you take the group up here and some of us are saying we like to go on 140 and some of us are saying we don't like the bill on 140 you know you have one person saying that that this would be fine when companies thing is fine my fear is that it only gets worse as it gets through the process because most of your colleagues don't like my company very much	 much so the political process in my view makes a very bad Bill start just get worse and this is all to help tobacco Growers so it doesn't it's not a good business equation the maid or a political equation now on the grower part if it were separated from FDA you know could we use a different base here can we you know can we come to a different funding source again we'd be happy to support it but we can't pay for	 okay thank you for house my sister thank God that I have not attempt to offer a ray of Hope although I do want to be like Norm in the rest of this hearing where you know everyone agrees it Norm should be out a cheater sitting at the bar everybody loves him I think it's indicative I'll give you an observation I think as I said in my written and oral testimony this is an issue that has always had	 a lot of conflict disagreement over a whole range of issues but as you look at this panel you really have the largest tobacco company and then the smallest tobacco companies in agreement and the cars that are in the middle there used to be the real big players such as my company and BMW to a certain extent Lord the ones that are kind of caught and you know how do we compete and that's really the standard by which we look at whether it be a by outward FDA bill	 how do we how are we able to compete in the marketplace given the current Financial Dynamics not only from a existing statutory standpoint federal and state but also from a price standpoint price of a cartons of cigarettes for the premium brands for all four of us are now anywhere from you know $34 of carton we're four years ago there were approximately $19 according the lower end in the cinema guys they can sell because they have a built-in price advantage	 can sell a carton of cigarettes and do for between 12 and 17 dollars according to you think about that in terms of purchasing Behavior over a period of year for a for a smoker that's a lot of money there for a lot of volume as mood from the majors to the low end and probably will continue to move because of that price Advantage so I mean it's the way that the market works so then to say on top of that okay we want another 19 billion dollars out of the guys that are already making the	 payments already making phase two payments you know government collected 135 billion dollars from smokers between 1998 and 2002 in the vacuum of this legislation it seems fairly meager but in the context of what's going on and how people are actually trying to compete is very very impactful so I think you will continue continue at least among some to see very noticeable disagreement and very drop depositions of no we're not going to pay	 okay I see my time is up but I would just suggest that of course what we're interested in is some relief our tobacco farmers and that's first and foremost what we're interested in and I would just suggest if anybody has anything they'd like to talk to me privately about but that where we could reach some common ground and maybe you don't want to State your thoughts as candidly as you'd like publicly but I'd be open to hear from anyone	 this meeting at any time at your convenience thank you thank you I would like to meet talk to you some congressmen and I think there is a way we can get there I think gentleman gentleman from Georgia mr. Burns you mr. chairman I thank the panel I appreciate your willingness to share your input and your expertise want to focus on maybe a couple of things one again going back to the farm cigarette manufacturers if there is a buyout and again perhaps your position should be	 be that burden of the payment for that buyout should not be borne by the consumer by your organization's but if there were about how would these four how should these are manufacturers be treated under Abaya is Dawson	 I'm not sure there are enough foreign cigarettes being brought into the u.s. I think sure that's what he doing agile is Dottie for how much foreign importation of finished product we have sort of an animal team 18 billion sticks as a percent no Tommy's a as a percentage is what as a percent it would be less than 5 it's a growing yes it is Sir and the reason is price right again	 if we get a biome and if we utilize one of the models or two of the models have been presented here and we look at the payments coming through the consumer how would you collect that from a foreign manufacturer estimate Mr D thank you Congressman I'm very concerned about that as well some of the proposals look like the Congress is considering looking at which our market share is and sending you	 ability and of the year I have no doubt that the domestic companies and certainly the lady and gentleman sitting here would pay their bill if they were required to but I'm concerned that the foreign manufacturers who have escrow obligations that they're managing to avoid with relative ease we try to play the same game so if the money is not collected up front I think you're going to have a real problem and if even though it's a small percentage of the market if 8% or growing a percent defaults	 is the do fall back on the Congress to make up that difference or on the manufacturers do we get a second bill or the Farmers have a percent less money than promise so one of the things we're suggesting is to use the the excise tax federal excise tax mechanism collection mechanism when you hit the borders with imported cigarettes you have a upfront duty to pay that so we would suggest a mechanism that is an upfront payment rather than a will trust you to pay the bill type mechanism	 and they want to thank you want to make sure we have here is an equitable and fair implementation of any funding source certainly as we look at both the importation of raw product brought the back that you would use to blend into the domestic production in my environment for the importation of the finished product whether we're talking about cigars or whether we're talking about cigarettes FDA regulations are the key concern sort of that's going to be a	 a tough point but if not for us to get through as we as we consider this legislation and really interested in the impact that FDA regulations have on small manufacturer that those groups in the middle and those companies in the middle and then maybe the larger manufacturers give me a 2 second summary of where you see the problems are if we look at FDA and how it's going to treat these three different segments of our production environment	 perhaps we started Philip Morris because you're the biggest Grill in the world's easiest issue biggest issue for honest with FDA is going to be the complexity"
