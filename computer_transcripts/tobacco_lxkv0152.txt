we're back on the record in the beginning of take two times approximately 152,dr. Carson I think in the morning you as you mentioned that ammonia was naturally found in tobacco is that correct yes it does, Philip Morris introduce any ammonia in any form that is not, strike that this Philip Morris introduced in the manufacturing process any ammonia or ammonium compound, that is not naturally found in tobacco, I'm not absolutely sure if I think the answer is probably yes, what compounds, that are used in the manufacturing of cigarettes sold by Philip Morris contain ammonia, I haven't been involved in this area for for a number of years so I can't speak to precise materials that are currently currently being used and as I said I before I really can't remember all of the specifics in terms of what is naturally found in tobacco and what what isn't, as a general matter than do you recall any of the, compounds that may contain ammonia that are used in the manufacturing process, question maintain ammonia that that let me rephrase it are you aware of any compounds that, are using the manufacturing process, that, Philip Morris uses that, contain ammonia in any way in other words any ingredient dying let's take let's take the AP is there a monument at all in the AP yes this Philip Morris use the AP in the Recon process yes so therefore it would be fair to say that that's one compound, that Fillmore's uses that contains ammonia that's correct okay what about, phosphoric acid does Phillip Morris use phosphoric acid in any way in manufacturing of cigarettes I don't know about today like I said it's been a couple of years since I've been involved and did they did they use it when you were involved I don't leave I don't remember what about urea is Fillmore's use urea in the manufacture of leaf cigarettes yes and they are and they are out process correct yes and as Eureka, and in any way yes so that's another introduction of ammonia that's not naturally found in tobacco that Philip Morris uses in manufacturer cigarettes correct subject of the foot I'm not sure whether urea I don't remember whether you re is naturally found in tobacco or not, what about ammonium hydroxide does that used in all by Philip Morris in the manufacture of cigarettes, again currently I don't I don't know but I believe it was a material that was on the ingredient list, can you talk about that when you say the ingredient list the list of 599 gradients that were submitted to HHS exactly the form in 1993 and I 10 T3 Q hat did you have any involvement in the compilation of that list, that was part of my job my first came to the company what was part of your job the compilation of the list, how did you go about and compile on that list, the actual compilation had actually begun, in 84 85 something like that, the first list I believe was submitted in 18 1986, my involvement, my involvement from let's say 89 to 1992 and slightly Beyond had to do with making sure that one we had all of the information from all of the vendors that we bought materials that were added to Tobacco in the manufacture of cigarettes and that information was was accurate and complete, that was for a series of steps and then once we had that information to deal with an ongoing evaluation of the Regulatory and safety aspects of the use of those materials as their attitude tobacco in the manufacture of cigarettes, maybe by the safety aspects of these things these materials as they are added to tobacco, Pizza, is a toxicologist its, common practice in terms of the utilization of materials to evaluate the consequences of how those materials are being used in in the finished product, and that's what the people myself in the people that work for me to safety involve and your mind, impart the health consequences of the use of these products these of these ingredients in park as well as the other part has to it has also to do with the regulatory use of these there are tobacco regulations around the world that dictate specifically what you're allowed to use or not allowed to use in the product, are there some products strike that are there's some ingredients that Philip Morris uses for example and products in the United States that it can't use and thus in the products of cigarettes that are sold in other countries subject to for the question as to time, since my my involvement that I specifically know about but I believe it predates me there's a policy in the company that any ingredient that has been banned anywhere in the world will not be used anywhere any Philip Morris product, and so it's your understanding that that policy presently is adhere to if for example the Canadian government bans a certain use of a ingredient then it would not appear in a in a in a product sold by Philip Morris the United States correct or anywhere in the world, how long has that policy been in effect I said it predates me, since you joined the company or are you aware of an ingredient that has been banned by a government that, is no longer sold in any no longer used in any product that Philip Morris cells in other words how do that that instance arise where product you were formerly used it was banned somewhere there for Philip Morris determined to Banner worldwide on a worldwide basis in any cigarettes old object to the form of the question it's actually hard for me to understand if you understand I've actually I'm having a real hard time that's because it's not a very difficult question so I, just not being articulate about it we try again is there any instance in you can recall since you've been with the company where certain government and the world banned the use of the ingredient and therefore Philip Morris determined to then not use that ingredient anywhere and not that I can not that I can remember do you know that it's you know that occurring anytime, even if it predated your employment Fillmore's that that you were aware of it, I believe there was an ingredient in what was then the government of Yugoslavia is no longer that suck this predates me that somebody discovered a tobacco regulation that forbid the use of some some compound and I think that compound may have been present in some some products somewhere in the Philip Morris, family and then when that was discovered it was it was eliminated, before we broke for lunch she talked about certain allegations being made in you did I think mentioned that there were allegations surrounding the use of ammonia could you elaborate on what your understanding was regarding allegations surrounding the use of ammonia and cigarettes, I can try the allegations, circumscribe the series of points that Philip Morris Philip Morris is use of ammonia is intended to modify the word you like to use delivery of nicotine from from the cigarette, by changing the pH, I think that that that more or less captures it can't you have a personal opinion as to the validity of that allegation, yes it what is your opinion on that given my understanding of, the role ammonia plays in the manufacturing process and the use of ammonia either in terms of process or were flavors that the nicotine that's found in tobacco either in the bound form or the Unbound form would generally be insensitive under commercial cigarette processes or use to, affect any effect of ammonia at the temperatures in which the cigarette is smoked all of these different forms of nicotine would become inconsequential in terms of their thermal differences fall well below the temperatures in which the burning coal of the cigarette occurs, number one number two that to achieve the ammonia levels that could affect smoke pH if there was such a thing would probably create a situation that would be intolerable in terms of of the consumer at best it would create a situation akin to smoking a big fat cigar, and thirdly that even if you could alter the pH with with ammonia or with with with something else that the buffering capacity of the body would basically neutralize that and fifth there's scientific evidence out there that the absorption from the lung is independent of the pH so when you take all of these facts, together I think what you have is an allegation not based on any sound science but generates quite a bit of an emotional emotional reaction to say to say the least, so that's That's the basis for my answer, well, with respect to the I believe at least five factors that you just presented with respect to your opinion of the validity of allegations surrounding the use of ammonia default Waters conductivity written studies that would support the opinion that you just gave me a to form the question, I believe they're there were and there continue to be the preparation of documentation by the scientists with with in R&D to address to address these issues, did you discuss allegations regarding nicotine manipulation with anyone of Philip Morris at any time object to the question to the extent that it seeks to elicit conversations that he had with with lawyers which would be protecting all the attorney-client privilege but you go ahead and answer otherwise independent of any answer that would cover lawyer conversations, the the discussions that have occurred in our occurring, with within the R&D organization among them in stood still going on, and what is your role in these discussions, well when when they occur and when I'm available I go when I listen and if I have a thought or a question, I raised it there are some some scientists with with in R&D who have a focus responsibility on this area and from from time to time we talk about what they're doing where they are with and where they're going when you say this area what do you mean by that what's their focus responsibility the area that you're referring to with regard to the allegations with respect to ammonia and nicotine and PA, well if a scientist has a focus responsibility in regard to the allegations of nicotine beautiful ation for example what what do they do in their job at Philip Morris, it connects you with that Al Gore so I'm not I don't really understand what you mean when you say they've let me let me try surfing there are people who review the allegations and underlying data such as it might be cited or used as support for these allegations and when you read those documents they usually have references associated with them so you have to go back and read those references it's a rather extensive technical evaluation so there are physicists, chemists analytical chemist aerosol physicists, people like myself, and we sit and we talk about, what these data mean and then there's a fair amount from that side of calculations in terms of how could this possibly be true under what conditions and then how does that relate to a cigarette so pan cows work which is a focus now of evaluation doesn't really deal with cigarettes so the question is how do you extrapolate what he's done to you to the product to evaluate the claims to, see what degree of credibility is associated with what kind of work might we need to do what kind of work might we need to support what kinds of questions need need to be addressed, have you presented the opinions that you gave me 2 with respect to the allegation about the use of ammonia to Philip Morris Rd folks in other words you richer Cartman ever, articulated your views on the allegations in any way in any way similar to the way you've given them to me pretty much with the same words yes, has anyone at Philip Morris disagreed with you with respect to any part of the opinion that you gave to me, the disagreement in R&D is sort of like breathing we're always arguing with each other and challenging each other so if if I were to to say to Cliff Lilly who's a physicist a physical chemist that is the buffering capacity of the body that's going to make anything that might happen meaningless he would challenge me in a way similar to the way you're attempting to challenge me to get more, in a constructive way to get more to get more information you know it's easy words are easy show me the data show me the equations show me the show me the studies if there are no studies you know that's the kind of disagreement or challenging that goes on did anybody say no there's data out there that says you're off base is there a general consensus in your view, that this the folks at R&D support the opinions that you've reached regarding the validity of allegations regarding ammonia juice from the physics and chemistry people there's no doubt in their mind in terms of their arguments in terms of the biological arguments what's missing is any hard, data so the arguments that somebody like me puts forth are based on analogy, and one of the just so we're clear what would you say the biological arguments what what which ones were you referring to in that answer if you take your some of your questions to me about the non protonated nicotine and getting more nicotine to the brain, what data exists out there that would support a refute, show me the data what other ideas in your mind did you have when you refer to by logical arguments was that I know I'll just try to understand separate the biological from the other arguments the answer to your question about you get more nicotine in the non protonated state is the biological argument I'm talking about okay, if, if there's a pretty clear consensus at least among certain, aspects, of the chemistry with regard for example to the use of them the allegation regarding use of ammonia why is Philip Morris continue to study the question objective formula question, it sounds to me like it's fairly well established at least in the minds of those that work in R&D and Philip Morris that there's no basis to any allegations regarding for example with the use of ammonia to heighten nicotine delivery why is that being reviewed the wise data that suggests contrary results be looked at by Philip Mars object to the form of the question, the point is we may have data that we think is convicted convincing on a perspective but there are other people out there that have a different perspective in a fair and objective world the resolution of such a conflict is based on data and to date that kind of data, doesn't exist to date the kind of data that would refute the evidence talking about reputation the question is of evaluation okay who knows who's right here the chemist and the physicists within the company have a position that I think is a valid solid position the answer to your question as it relates does if you could generate non protonated nicotine in tobacco smoke, cigarette and if somebody smoked it with that have a different effect, whatever that effect is then if you smoked a cigarette that had less non protonated nicotine the answer to that question there is no data to answer it one way or the other and for me given my persuasion and my my training is an important unanswered question pankow doesn't address that nobody has nobody has addressed it so in other words the at this point it's merely, your mind and allegation aren't supported by data correct that's right, it's not an allegation in your mind that has been refuted by data either correct objective just to the extent that the it is undefined, it's neither been proven more reflective and that's is Philip Morris attempted to either prove or refute it at this point Philip Morris is exercise here is in trying to determine what is going on turns out to be a refutation so be it if it turns out to be a confirmation so be it we're just trying to determine what if anything is going on, do you think if you were asked to advise Philip Morris Management on an issue as to, strike that let me start over let's assume for a moment that after Philip Morris is revealed data that or has analyzed the issue and has determined that the allegations regarding the use of ammonia to heighten unprotonated nicotine delivery is valid, would you advise for manner Fort Myers to make the findings that they have uncovered a tardy public, particular formula questioners and incomplete hypothetical or it's based upon a faulty premise, I don't think I would have to go that far I think the situation is such that Philip Morris whoever Philip Morris is would would do the right thing here and go to the right kinds of people and ask for for advice possibly including the Food and Drug Administration, is your opinion that that since you've been at the company that Philip Morris has always done the quote the right thing when when it comes a strike that was done the right thing in terms of its public disclosure of information about smoking that it has researched would you read that question back please, is it your opinion that since you've been at the company that Philip Morris has always done called the right thing when it comes strike that done the right thing in terms of its public disclosure of information about smoking that it has researched objection the question is incredibly Broad and vague, I would not work for a company that behaved any other way, would you work for a company that, you knew that behaved, it's right that would you work for a company that you found had not behaved responsibly in terms of disclosing information knew about its product or the effect of its products prior to the time you came to the company jet to the full of questions and complete hypothetical so so very broad but if you can answer it go ahead and pin in a, oh principal sort of way probably not have you attempted dr. Clarkson to, analyze the issue of whether Philip Mars had prior to your coming Philip Morris acted responsibly in disclosing what it do about cigarette smoking, let me let me rephrase a coup skeleton, incomprehensible the further we go so let's try it again what did you make any attempt to find out the answer to a question as to whether Philip Morris had acted irresponsibly in any way connection with failing to disclose information to do about smoking and health prior to the time you came to the company objection it's overly broad vague it's argumentative bingo, there's some cool even giving the answer question go ahead I can try to answer in part when I came to work for Philip Morris in December of 1988, I had done so in the following way I had taken a sabbatical, from Medical College of Virginia with the agreement of my chairman and my Dean and with the agreement of Philip Morris management that was a university nerdy type with one tie and I just wasn't sure whether I would like them where they would like me, and at the end of that year when I had an opportunity to meet travel around meet the different folks see what they were doing how they were doing it why they were doing why they were doing it I made a decision to stay in Philip Morris I went back and I told my chairman and Dean that I was going to end my sabbatical year and come to work for Philip Morris so I, say yeah I had read a lot about the tobacco industry not specifically Philip Morris and many of the allegations I had read the surgeon general's report from from 64 many many years ago, and, to me what, what convinced me was that one year I spent working working at the company within the Rd organizations and meeting the folks in seeing what seeing what they were doing and in terms of Philip Morris meeting and interacting with some of the people who I think make some of the some of the key decisions and rather than being recognizable by having horns or or long tails what I found was that these were very reasonable response responsible people, in a very difficult Public public environment and that contributed to my decision to stay when you say difficult public environment what do you mean by difficult public of iron typical public environment it doesn't take much imagination in terms of the General Media television radio the Press kangaroo type court session that Waxman and his colleagues had, in in Washington what really seems to be at the modification vilification of the entire Tire industry things being League taking out of context unfair and unbalanced reporting of issues erroneous reporting of facts I think David must do at Yale recently described this as a near peak of the temperance mood in this in this country there are folks in Washington, know what's good for everybody and nobody knows what's good for them but the people in Washington will will tell you so it it's a very very strident Temperance puritanical position with tobacco sort of in the vortex right now, undeserved in your opinion of course Jack the folder questions argumentative undeserved in what sense and the fact that tobacco has been brought into the or forced into the Vortex of this climate in Washington is in Your Mind undeserved Correct there are no Guiltless people in any of these events, there are no guilt let people without guilt in any of these events including the tobacco industry everyone, but so the records clear including the tobacco industry everyone including the tobacco industry, what way do you think the tobacco industry share some of the guilt, I think the total legal and Regulatory environment has put enormous constraints on the ability of companies including tobacco companies to make certain kinds of certain kinds of Public public statements and maybe they should have found other ways better ways of doing it it's not my area it's not my area of expertise I'm not a Communications person I'm not, look relations person but again in a fair and open environment you would think that there would be an opportunity for all sides to be heard, and maybe Philip Morris should have tried to explore some other ways of doing it I know it's frustrating for people like myself in terms of how quiet, Philip Morris has been there some understanding this is related to Securities and Exchange restraints and legal restraints and settlement restraints but at least for many of my colleagues in R&D we were sort of hoping we'd hear more from from Philip Morris, let's take a five-minute break, sure the last series of questions that you were asking me sort of the rather extensive and torture was track from the spiking the moon the manipulation to sort of the last the last part just want to make make sure you understand they were all connected, all connected to me back to those back to those questions, okay, and, and so just if I can try to to because when I gave my answer at the end there was some body language and it wasn't just simply you trying to read what was up there that I wasn't sure you I made myself clear, and I was like okay okay that's fine I'm not actually clear on the point you're trying to make so I'll allow you to make your point again and maybe clarify what you mean okay the the question that you were asking me and I responded about all the parties and what was going on and I said nobody was Guiltless right and so you twist a little bit and then you said you mean even the Philip Morris and I said yes nobody would what, what I was trying to say Marianne effectively was that in my world which I don't think exists very much anymore scientific World in which fair and objective facts are laid out people make a determination is its spiking a real thing or is it phenomena or is it BS is manipulation real does ammonia really do this does you find a technical venue you sit down you present the data if there's no data, you go and do the expiry find someplace to do the experiment and you do it and for me the part that really irks me and a lot of my colleagues about Philip Morris is that Philip Morris whoever that is didn't speak out as strongly as it should have you know there are a lot of folks back in R&D who have done all this work that we're talking about which my opinion is just one of one of many and yet we're, lie silent on this we haven't gone out to the right kinds of venues and for me a scientist it would be the scientific the scientific community and and done this and there is a tremendous degree of frustration on my part in a lot of my colleagues part because it and that's that's really where I was where I was coming from this to show when you say that, there are a lot of folks back in warranty who have done all this work that were talking about, and yet we're relatively silent we're being filmed Mars what do you mean that there's a lot of folks who have done all this work I'm not sure what you mean by that you when you asked me earlier what it was they were doing so it's the the cliff lilies and folks that work with with Cliff doing these calculations doing these reviews were reviewing the references in there sitting and critiquing the pankow work trying to, Dan how this work goes from studies in the laboratory to statements he makes about cigarettes what we know about cigarettes what we know about ammonia what we know about nicotine that's the kind of work that the work that the analyses maybe that's better the analyses its work the analyses that were done by a number of people within Philip Morris basically say these allegations are just not based on Soundcloud not based on sound science, and give Philip Morris give the scientists a chance to debate with Scientists on this on this issue and it hasn't happened yet, so I think I understand what you're saying but I just want to make sure and do your say that there's been some analysis done at p.m. that would tend to disprove or expose the lack of scientific Merit in allegations that are being made but that Philip Morris has not released, that work, to the public so that the public were that the hasn't released at work to the scientific community so that the scientific Community would see that the allegations are unfounded is that what you're trying to set that object to the form of the question you can answer but that that's a fair a restatement have you ever talk to anyone at Philip Morris about why Philip Morris has not released, analysis that's been formed in house that would in your opinion refute the unfounded allegations that are being made the circles that that I play in our technical technical people so we end up asking those same goes for the same questions to ourselves well you're certainly not you know a staff level scientists have Philip Morris I think it's fair and, maybe the correct me if I'm wrong to say that you are in the management levels at or indeed p.m. is that fair to say yes it was sorry and you have contact with management people in New York on a fairly regular basis isn't that fair to say yes and those are the folks that run the company Philip Morris USA the folks that we're talking about in New York the management level types correct that's correct have you ever had occasion to, say to the folks in New York hey we have the goods to prove that these people are making baseless allegations about work we do why don't we why don't we release the result of our work to the scientific Community to show that you know we're being unfairly picked on, the answer to your question is our Indie management are all scientists or technical people and we've had this discussion innumerable times when it gets out of R&D and moves up to the next levels and in the chain the answer we often get it's coming they don't say no don't do it they say it's, if it's coming we will we will be releasing its Brett do you have an opinion dr. Carson as you sit here today as to why it hasn't been forthcoming yet know the Q in your opinion do you think it's related at all to the web of litigation as Philip Morris is currently involved in that would contribute to that decision and I want you to answer the question only, the extent that you would not reveal conversations that you may have had with legal counsel about that point if you can if you can answer my question independently of a conversation you might have with either lawyers in New York at p.m. or your outside counsel please answer if you can't answer the question without revealing that please tell me that I cannot answer, sir that question without revealing Communications I've had with counsel objected the folder question and if you wouldn't mind just reading back the question that not all necessarily all the explanation we just the question for today I'm going to read it that for you Greg okay in your opinion do you think it's related at all, to the web of litigation at Philip Morris is currently involved that would contribute to that decision an objective form of the question it's also argumentative but you can go ahead and answer the question if you can, I don't I don't think so, okay that's that's the answer why do you what other reasons do you believe Philip Morris has not, stepped up and answered the allegations when in your opinion it has the the evidence to do so object to the form of the question this is real hard this is an opinion sure okay I just like personally think that that we would be spitting in the wind given the current the current environment that, even the the scientific Community right now, is in a situation where because of all of the public and political pressures don't want to get too close to anything associated with with tobacco, have you all had discussions with dr. Ellis regarding, whether or not Philip Morris come forward with the evidence that it has in-house to dispute what you believe are baseless allegations of, irresponsible conduct of Philip Morrison's the sale of cigarettes object to the form of the question I think it's argumentative but you're talking about the ammonia pH allegations I'm talking about allegations at all that have been made against Philip Morris with respect to manipulation spiking adding of ammonia things that we discussed here today dr. Ellis has been party to many of the technical, relations and inevitably near the end of these technical conversations this request you know is one I think that she shares with with with many of us the same same kinds of feelings in other words she's expressed to you maybe not directly but in her and it may be in a group setting the same types of frustrations about Phil, Mars is reluctance to release data that would answer the charges that have been made against the company objective for the question mistakes his prior testimony concerning data what the dr. Ellis and I share is frustration over an environment in which not scientifically supportable allegations are made and, Leti to refute them almost seems futile gives the appearance of futility, is your is it your opinion that the tobacco's industry the tobacco industry's past conduct and, certain media exposure about its past conduct through the leaking of documents in the like has played a part, in, the current, political and social position that the industry now faces which we think question please let me rephrase it because there's it might have been convoluted as European that's the backhoe Industries past conduct, has played a part in the current political and social position that the industry faces now object to the form of question it all those caption terms of opinion it's just calls for speculation, it's it's it's such a broad such a broad question I really wouldn't know where to begin around do you think that the tobacco industry has it has, any responsibility, for the position politically and socially that it faces today object to the form of the question calls for speculation Also may call for a legal conclusion, you can answer, nothing to the to the extent that there are many participants in, in this including the tobacco the tobacco industry that all participants they are some responsibility for the current the current situation, including plaintiffs lawyers in that all participants, who's the participants that you would include in that group dr. Carpenter, I think you have the tobacco industry specific tobacco companies you have a variety of politicians with a variety of Interest both self and and Community you have the Public Health Community which is not a monolithic structure but covers a wide spectrum of of of interest from true and sincere interest to less than true and less, Stan sincere to a variety of of lawyers that have eleemosynary or less than eleemosynary attributes associated with are with with their behavior it covers the whole gamut of human human behaviors and and endeavors, that's correct you've heard the allegation that cigarette smoking causes 400,000 people to die each year have it or not you've heard that allegation made in the United States and I say it's I've heard the allegation, to find out to be a credible statement based on science do I find it incredible to be a credible statement based on science I find it incredible statement not credible not not grounded in science or medicine object in the form of question I' not grounded in science is a grounded medicine I don't know what you mean by medicine	 dr. Carson is part of the	 settlement that was reached between the back of companies and the Attorney General's a few months ago Philip Morris as you may know has agreed to put certain labels warranty labels on it cigarettes let's assume for a moment that there's Federal legislation that passes and Philip Mars as agreed to do puts on its label that cigarette smoking is addictive	 is that statement that may appear on the label well grounded in science in your opinion rejected the formula question you can answer it sent no you can't you gets into the settlement that's highly inappropriate and he's not going to answer questions concerning the settlement or the or the proposed labor labeling regime and that let's rephrase it but rephrase it is it if if I lay if a warning label would appear	 on a Philip Morris cigarette as it does in certain countries that says nicotine smoking	 strike that that says nicotine is addicted is that well grounded in science hold on for second read that question back would you please bring it back let me let me rephrase it	 if a warning label that toolbars uses says it's cigarette smoking is addictive do you believe that's a well-grounded statement in science I'm going to object to the question in terms of the phraseology that Philip Morris uses well it's all labels of cigarettes so ourselves in certain countries so it's certainly not an incorrect factual statement I'm wondering whether dr. Carson believes it that has a valid scientific basis for that	 warning label well same objection I'm going to also object as to foundation with regard to whether this witness is capable of answering that question also started to ask him expert opinion questions he's not designated as an expert in this case you can answer I'm not sure if you can are you asking my opinion questions I'm not he he's not an expert in this case mr. Fowler and I'm not asking	 questions of an expert variety and I'm asking dr. Carson his personal opinion as a Senior Management individual at Philip Morris R&D and it's a fair question and you can answer I'm not getting a colloquy with counsel I'm asking my questions and I expect dr. Carter to answer unless he's instructed not to	 sir I need to take a break on this then for a second I'd like to make a statement on the record before we break and I believe that the area of nicotine addiction is subject to expert testimony in this case however there will be Philip Morris employees who have information is dr. Carson maybe well be one of those employees and if he's not he may tell us	 and that's why I was making the objection as you recall as the foundation if you want to ask me the foundation questions than that that's another thing but I needed to have brief conversation with Council so we can get a break for a minute I think there's a question pending actually is them sorry the question is	 is the statement that appears on what certain labels that and cigarettes fulmars cells that state that cigarette smoking is addictive	 well grounded in science in my objection is as to Foundation because you have to establish this witness has the expertise to address questions as to quote addiction unquote okay	 you can answer this answer well I'm not a expert on addiction I'm not really sure what the	 what the word means in the context that you're talking about on a warning label so it would be speculation on my part this part I don't don't feel very much like speculating	 is it fair to hit the problem then that you're having my question is the fact that I tied addiction and warning labels together rejected the form in other words are you troubled I don't want to speculate because you're not sure the significance that that statement might have in the context of it appearing on a warning label	 I think my answer is yes if I understand your question is both a warning label and the addiction question okay will be approached it from another perspective	 as the issue of whether or not nicotine is addictive into human beings been something that you've ever considered while at Philip Morris get to the form of the question	 this is something that we continue to to discuss within the R&D organization and we continue to support research in this area to try to give us a better technical understanding of the question	 who when you say to discuss with in R&D it sir individuals is there an individual or individuals that are d That's that has responsibility for the analysis of whether nicotine is addictive to human beings object to the form of the question when I say nicotine let's just be clear nicotine in cigarettes not talk about nicotine	 outside of cigarettes stuff up next nicotine in cigarettes	 there is a group of individuals within our D who have a responsibility for the general area of understanding the biology and chemistry of nicotine yes and one of the issues they study is whether dictators addicted objective from the question that is a an area of discussion yes	 who are the individuals that you're referring to myself	 Frank loto	 Cindy Hayes	 Ken Schaefer	 Jeff Seaman	 Bruce Davies Peter Le Povich hans-juergen houseman	 Jerry Nixon	 has that bid the group that's been responsible for the issue strike to how long was that group strike that let me ask it again	 have there been individuals at Philip Morris as far as you know that we're responsible for studying these issues that are no longer responsible for that study could you define these issues the issues that we talked about	 be the biology chemistry of the cartoon	 not since I've been at generally that's for the same group yeah no no that that's a different question the group that I described to you is a group that is currently looking at this	 historically over at least the time that I've been there they've been there been other individuals some of which are included on the list of names I gave you tell me the individuals without repeating these names that all you've been there we're also looking at this at some point in time	 the individuals object to the form of the question is as vague as to these issues happen if we're talking about nicotine wheel and then Frank load it and Cindy Hayes during the time that I've been in Philip Morris have been writing working on these issues	 who now that you mentioned maybe seven other individuals that have also working on nicotine issues they're working on nicotine issues as it relates to this group is really under my direction for what's called a technology assessment group to provide technical understanding of nicotine	 all aspects of nicotine and that group has been together with that with that responsibility for less than a year	 did this group exists under a different name prior to a year ago I don't want you to the phone the question why don't we were individuals looking at nicotine in the sense of chemical	 and by all and biology aspects of nicotine prior to yoga	 Beyond doctors dr. golota and Mrs Hayes I would say from from time to time for specific questions some of the other names that I've given you were involved a name that I haven't given you that's been involved from time to time was dr. Joe banyas	 he's a physical chemist	 would you agree doctor car treating that	 there's a consensus in the Public Health Community outside of Philip Morris not kind of Philip Morris being in the Public Health Community but outside the Public Health Community that nicotine is addictive nicotine that cigarette smoking is addictive and at the source of that addiction is - objective for the questions already stated that he's not an expert in the area	 and to the extent that you're calling for an expert opinion it's objectionable	 if you know the answer to that question	 you can go ahead and answer it and I think it is a general consensus within Public Health Community is it still is that is it an open question I thought Wars however is what an open question objective form the question you have to clarify mr. Fowler I do ask you again	 to State your objections concisely and please don't interfere with the question and thank you I'm not interfering I'm making a valid objection you have to Define your terms of the question is meaningless so I'm just asking you to please make your question not vague you could answer dr. Carter if you understand it only if you understand what it means by it could you reread the question	 you answered	 to a question as to whether cigarette smoking was addictive	 strike that let me just ask you the question is the question of whether cigarette smoking is addictive	 an open question within thought Wars are and d.c. rejection with regard to expertise so also questioning about an undefined term	 if you understand the question you can go ahead and answer	 within then the R&D environment when the scientist talk about nicotine and questions of Addiction come up to areas remain open	 one has to do with the ever-changing	 definition of addiction itself	 and number two is the scientific basis for that addiction within the context of an ever-changing definition	 so it's really a question that the dimensions of the Box keep keep changing so you can end up putting things different things in the box and the basis for putting them in the box becomes less and less scientifically based	 where we at now depending question no we don't wear no movement of thought	 I'll tell you in a minute	 are you aware of the definition of addiction as it has been promulgated under the DSM 4	 gentle form of question	 I have read parts of the DSM 4	 document in the in the past so I have read it my recollection is is not very crisp or are you aware of that	 cigarette smoking has been classified as addictive behavior under the dsm-4 objective form of the question that the state's the characterization from the dsm-4 it's also Beyond this Witnesses expertise	 again my my recollection is not as crisp as it would be and if I remember correctly the dsm-4 is a is a document put together by psychiatrists and I'm not a I'm not a psychiatrist nor am I trained in in Psychiatry or psychology so between the my lack of crisp recollection and the the psychiatric focus of that	 I really can't add anything more to question	 are there individuals with his Philip Morris today that believe that nicotine is an addicting agent who checked the form of question uses an undefined term you can eat to eat there was a word in there that didn't come across clearly to me okay let me rephrase it are there individuals with it felt Mars that believe that	 nicotine is an addicting agent is an addicting right and is an addicting agent objective form that a fair she should Define your terms so you can answer and that's not a valid objection also calls for speculation	 I'm reflecting back on on the conversations I've	 I would say I probably have heard from time to time	 people saying that maybe for some individuals under some conditions	 Smoking may be an addictive behavior it may or may not be nicotine I've heard I've heard that mentioned in technical technical technical discussions	 is nicotine a drug	 you can't be	 what's your definition of a drug	 I have	 maybe more than one level of	 of explanation	 you can offer those different levels of explanation can a drug is a material that may or may not be naturally found	 in the body	 that is generally used at levels that are different than what is naturally found if it is a naturally occurring material to modify a particular pathway	 or function	 that's one level what's another level another level is a a drug is a material that is given for the treatment of some disorder okay either other levels probably so do you have other levels in your mind nut not it dis at this hour that sort of right rise up screen to be spoken	 that's okay let's let's go back to nicotine has a certain not a not a drug under this the second level that you just articulated with respect to its being used in treatment correct it's not true so it is nicotine and Drug under both levels it can be	 and it may not be	 it depends on depend on	 well nicotine is a drug for treatment it's used in the in the treatment of several several disorders clinical disorders from ulcerative colitis to Tourette's Syndrome to some experimental work on Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease is nikitina drug as it is used in the smoking of cigarettes and your view objective for	 you can go ahead and answer no is it unfair to say that nicotine is a that strike to is it unfair in your mind to call cigarette and nicotine delivery device	 subject to the full who's who's calling it me if I'm calling a drug delivery device in making unfair statement about the	 strike that	 can you believe that it's fair to call a cigarette a drug delivery device and the drug be the river is - object to the form of the question fear is based on what criteria is that is that is that an accurate assessment in your mind of the way strike that	 business cigarette doctor a drug delivery device	 objective for the question I mean from the fda's perspective I guess if I guess it might be given their their criteria	 these are criteria are mind	 a scientific criteria no don't think so is it a public health criteria probably so and for the public health perspective is a cigarette a drug delivery device subject the folder question calls from the speculative answer if the FDA is part of the responsibility of dealing with the public health and they've made that that statement and it would seem logical	 the answer would seem very logical and your mind is that not why you're mine is the fda's criteria not	 a scientific criteria number one it seems to make up a whole series of assumptions that to my knowledge are not based in hard scientific fat	 for example	 do people smoke for nicotine	 if you follow through on your questioning the FDA assumes people smoke for nicotine	 I asked what's the hard scientific data that exists that says that's true	 port for example	 what are some other assumptions that are not based in fact objective from the question what assumptions you can answer the phone talking about I don't it's okay I'm not asking you well if I built and people who are reading this deposition transcript won't and that's all the better for you mr. Fowler what's not I want to make sure that this deposition is clear and you'll clean it up when you have your chance you can answer the question back	 what are some other assumptions that are not based in fact	 if you can answer that question and you're better than I am at even go ahead but I'm check to the fiberglass answer because the question directly relates to okay	 read that the even read that Dutch courses last answer that revamp my question maybe it'll make more sense to mr. Fowler	 number one it seems to make a whole series of assumptions that to my knowledge are not based in hard scientific fact for example do people smoke for nicotine if you follow through on your questioning the FDA assumes people smoke for nicotine and I asked what's the hard scientific data that it is not that says that's true for example and my question was what are some other assumptions that are not based in fact you can answer that same objection we had a series of grow your question	 relating to the subjective qualities of nicotine those subjective qualities are at a different level than the ones that FDA seems to be concerned concerned about relating to the whatever the addictive properties of nicotine might be rather than whatever	 I'll call them pleasurable or satisfying property subjectively satisfying qualities that might be associated with the smoking smoking experience	 are you aware of Philip Morris study the question of whether people smoke for nicotine	 read that question back please	 are you aware of Philip Morris studying the question of whether people smoke for nicotine Churchill form the question assumes facts not in evidence I'm not aware of such a study	 your mind is that something that you would recommend if they ask the Fillmore should study	 I think that's not an unreasonable question	 I'm having a little trouble with the double negative so why would I try to rephrase it I can rephrase it or you can what you refer to ask me another question to ask another question there's no question pending okay ask this question is that something you would recommend if they ask the salt marsh should study yes	 fulmars strike that	 do you have an understanding as to why Philip Morris is not currently studying the question	 I didn't I didn't finish we just	 why	 we are faced with you understand is why Philip Morris not currently studying the question of why of whether people smoke for nicotine assumes facts not in the rapid you can answer	 Philip Morris is is supporting several lines of research that may may touch on	 on this issue	 but not directly address it head-on like we're not working in subjects no I'm sorry not with human subjects do you think they should be studying with human subjects jet to the form of the question	 probably scientific perspective unique in a perfect world yes with without plaintiffs lawyers and write all of those kinds of people	 if the precise correct questions could be frame and this and the correct study designed	 I think that would be a reasonable question do you think that one of the reasons why Philip Morris does not undertake the study certain issues that may be of interest to the company is the fact that the results of studies may be produced in litigation against the company subject to the full moon	 calls for speculation	 I'm not aware of any such thing happening the answer is no	 do you think the fact of lawsuits against Philip Morris has in any way impeded the company's research and development efforts objective for the question calls for speculation sir	 so had an enormous impact of my ability not to do my job I'm sorry it had an enormous impact on me spending time in situations like this not doing what I was when I was hired to do and I'm not I'm just one one little person	 other than taking time away from people's jobs at R&D and I'm not including that in my question I understand what you just said but I'm going to ask you a different question do you think that litigation of the threat of litigation has somehow	 impacted	 research and development effort within Philip Morris rejected for the question he calls for speculation Soul so vague	 I think one of the examples I gave before in terms of trying to address dr. pan cows studies and allegations has impacted our Deeds ability to do what Rd is been normally task to do in terms of now having to redirect resources to address those kinds of issues why in your mind does Fillmore's egauge and studies in reaction to studies that	 are published on the outside you either question back only let me rephrase it why does Phillip Morris initiate studies in response to studies that are published on the outside	 I think Phillip Morris has a responsibility and acts upon that responsibility to try to understand what is being alleged or stated about the product or parts of the product I think that at that is responsible be responsible corporate Behavior Philip Morris doesn't as far as you understand engaged in studies in reaction to every article that might be published about its products that might not put its products in the	 favorable light correct the jet to the form of the question	 there's the perception and then the reality sometimes the perception is that we spend enormous amount of time in a reactive mode but at the end of the day the company's responses within in terms of our D our	 are related to the most credible and serious allegations not to every single lunatic out there who says I'm said something that's that's my point your selective and in studies that you pay attention to with respect to research efforts you might undertake in response to those correct check the Forum	 correct that's what tivity is impart the responsibility activity of the company are you trying to do you play any part in that selectivity responsibility yes and what areas do you personally play a part in that selectivity responsibility objection vague	 and if the answer is all areas of of the of the product and that might be the case I'm just learning how I now comes to smoking and health issues I generally am a participant who at the company is responsible for who's responsible for determining to engage in studies in response to outside studies on questions of	 nicotine addiction gentle for the question	 scientific investigations are the domain of dr. Kathy Ellis the head of R&D and her organization well you just said that you play a part in that process as well I'm part of dr. Ellis is organization who else would put well strike that then when I ask you to be a little more specific you said you were your area might be worn the smoking smoking Health area I'm just trying to find out who who would play that	 who would play the doctor course would roll for example in the nicotine addiction question area objective little question it would be a group of scientists that would include dr. Ellis dr. golota and myself and maybe dr. Richard Cox	 depending upon the specific specific dimension of question so you have some crossover utility in this area in other words you don't just play a role in the selectivity of smoking health issues but you may also play a role in the selectivity with respect to nicotine addiction as well it's not fair I'm sure to the form of the question	 as I indicated earlier and one of my responses to your question I'm responsible for this technology assessment group that deals with various aspects of nicotine so I've really answered that question in one of the other answers like game I'm sorry that's okay is just issues about nicotine addiction to you come under the smoking Health umbrella does your mind object to the form of the question yes	 let's take a short break and I placed before you what's been marked as Cartman exhibit 1 its bait stamped 2023 450 799 through	803	 and asked you to	 identify this document you can	 you know the words you can seen it before	 do you recall saying this document before I don't think so if you'll see on the third page page 80 one says bold statement responses generated from Cartman's for 1194 meeting and you see the 13 numbered paragraphs their jewelry called strike two do you recall seeing this part of the document no I don't do you recall	 meeting on or about April 11th 1994 where the subjects of nicotine addiction were considered at a meeting that you attended no	 at or around the time of the wax with hearing says they've come to be known as you talk as you alluded to them earlier today did you play any role in	 in formulating a Philip Morris response of sorts to those hearings I was in the hospital	 so you did not play any role	 look at these 13 points have you ever discussed at Philip Morris with anybody whether self-administration does or does not equate with addiction potential yes and what have you discussed about that the underlying scientific data that deals with as the animal self Administration studies both and	 rats and monkeys are you talking about internal studies or outside studies its own extra mistakes when you start to his footmarks ever studied self-administration among rats night while I was there I have they are you aware of them studying that before the time you came there yes and your talk about dr. denoble work yes did you ever review dr. Knowles work did you look	 the articles that he wrote about the work that he had done it feel worse	 we may have an if I did it was very very few and it was quite quite a number of years years ago	 you didn't write this bullet point forward statement response obviously right children a doctor but I don't know I may have had no idea	 do you recall the point to discuss it Philip Morris point to which says the classic addictive substances such as cocaine and heroin have a reinforcing effect hundreds of times greater Tom's are hundreds of times higher than nicotine or caffeine is that point been discussed by yourself with anyone Philip Morris yes when was that	 to call discussions with the within the technology assessment group and prior to the creation of the group with people like Frank Frank alota	 have you ever seen a scientific data that supports that statement	 yes we discussed that scientific that scientific data and Technical meetings	 is that scientific data that was done internally a thought Mars no is there anything in your mind as we see here today that you any study that you have a mind particular with respect to support for that statement	 back to name specific studies that suggest cocaine and heroin are more reinforcing yes	 are you aware of studies that disagree with that statement	 scientific studies that have data that disagree with that no okay point three	 John just just for clarification this was produced out of Philip Morris is file sitting I believe so it was I believe that the court would refer to their is probably the same gentleman that is sitting today at this deposition Antonio who wrote this document I do not	 I can address the question it did come from sources tiles I was trying to see some confusion the data production but I don't have that and this is how the document was produced	 I don't have any more information over there wa indicates that it's a Washington production that is a Philip Morris Pates number	 I guess I have to characterization number that it was produced in depository but it is not terminated with the fact that it was pretty simple well this this Breckenridge and make a representation that was produced by Philip Morris when you go from that to Gregory talk for a second	 back on the record and possibly 411 dr. Carson wanted just to clarify something with me which is why we took a short break to leave the room and that is that his recollection is that he was on medical leave for 1194 at least a date of this and doesn't recall having been at any meeting work you know on that date where this was discussed and he just wanted to clarify that with me and I swear to explain the reason for the break you have a is there any other cartridge that you're aware of	 yes no	 look at this document somewhat strange then it would have that date on it and your name associated with meaning that it appears to have taken place on that date when you were not physically present at the company on that day when we were in English he called the meeting and didn't attend or something like that that's why I just want to explain takes we just you know didn't recognize this guy course wanted to try to get that on the table for you I'll be frankly	 this document I don't think after cartridge	 is Strike let's just let's just	 let's just go on okay just so I'm clear I'm not objecting to your asking questions of this document just wanted to make you know the context of it as clear as possible or the point are there any points of this document dr. Cartman and I'm talking about page 80 one that you	 I have not discussed at Philip Morris house that we just take a second and read through those deaths	 I would I would say I'm really not sure what number seven refers to I guess I can't say whether I object to it or that for the record says just feel human data you're not sure what that means you know what about the other points on this document	 I don't recall ever discussing number 13	 which says if he's addicted why did Premiere which contains nicotine fail on the market everything else that's listed with the exceptions that I've given him I've been in in a party to discussions talked about the scientific data that supports some of these statements and is this the points here that are listed do you understand these to be points in favor of arguments as to why on nicotine	 is not addictive	 I don't know if I would frame it in such simple terms that I would say that these raised questions has to the whatever addiction whatever addiction means because many if not all of these things down here would be criteria that different people have used in putting a drug into	 particular kind of particular kind of box with number three being an attempt to ascribe a mechanism	 but a question what is that word in parentheses on number three	 I really can't make it out	 that's not your writing no would be more legible	 look it up page 80 3.12 in the first sentence it says it is our experience and there's parens I think there's certain initials and RAC is One initial and paren that smokers continue to smoke for a variety of reasons other than nicotine's purported addictive properties you have an understanding is that RAC referring to you could is that your initials yes is it fair to say that that's an accurate	 it's statement from your perspective that it's been your experience that smokers continue to smoke for a variety of reasons other than nicotine reported addictive properties	 let me read the rest of it	 in general yes if you see down there there's initials bdd at the bottom do you know what that stands for where's that at the bottom of the page	 I know what BD I don't know if I do a bdd what about a.j. Elsie do you have an idea who that would be Charles I believe that it's June and FG would probably be frank cullotta	 have you ever heard of who's the beanie that you know Bruce Davies have you ever heard anyone at Philip Morris espouse the hypothesis that the reason people smoke is for nicotine	 jet to the phone questions to time anytime	 but while he was at Thor's yes	 I would say in general no but as I answered her earlier to a question that you asked me about whether I had ever heard anybody say that they thought nicotine might be might be addictive I answered I believe I did hear that so within that context who'd you hear that from I don't know I mean I can't give you any specific names it was just in in what I would call the the heat of technical technical	 Russians could have even been in the lunchroom	 do you think there's	 a lack of scientific support for the proposition that nicotine is addictive we're going to make the objection as to expertise I made earlier but you go ahead and answer the question if you can mean since I'm not sure where we're starting from the same basis of of addiction that I'm not a psychiatrist it we're talking about pharmacological terms in the answer is no	 I can't speak to psychological or psychiatric definitions from a pharmacological perspective it's your opinion based on your	 work at Philip Morris that it's not addictive based upon my education and training and experience prior to coming to the Philip Morris said about since you've been a full long as I'm in my opinion hasn't changed have you done any work that would support at Philip Morris that would support that opinion me personally yes have you seen work at Philip Morris that would support that opinions I've seen work that Philip Morris has supported that would support that	 but nothing that's been internally generated from Philip Morris that would support that object to the form	 I'm not aware of any work that was ongoing	 at Philip Morris I would address that question while I've been there one way or the other did you what kind of training experience did you have prior to Philip Morris that would allow you to have a valid scientific basis for your opinion that it is not pharmacologically indicative of Joseph leading question okay 11 would be the fact of my background and training and education that	 up to the work I did in the department of pharmacology where I got my doctorate degree standard of courses in in Pharmacology and Physiology when I went to graduate school I did some work that was published in the Journal of pharmacology and experimental Therapeutics doing behavioral pharmacology looking at fixed interval fixed ratio effects	 of op8 and antagonists and behavioral changes study published in a high-quality peer-reviewed Journal it's viewed as one of the Hallmark papers for those class of compounds when I went to the Medical College of Virginia Department of pharmacology and toxicology it is a center director at that time the chairman was dr. Lewis Lewis Harris and there was a very large behavioral pharmacology group	 many of those folks are still there and they examined drugs of abuse the whole variety of drugs of abuse and other pharmacological agents and wide variety of drugs from cocaine heroin marijuana phencyclidine ketamine in animal behavioral paradigms I went to seminars discuss this with with my colleagues	 in the department I attended several International meetings at which some of these were discussed I actually had done some additional work on some of these substances not in behavioral paradigms but in in Cellular in cellular paradigms so I think prior to coming to Philip Morris I had what I would call a reasonable amount of training experience	 teas and interaction to it at least	 talk slightly more than casually about the behavioral pharmacological effects of at least some some materials and nicotine being one of those materials is it	 fair to say that there is a disagreement in the pharmacological Community with respect to whether nicotine is addictive	 disagreement	 in either their well studies that you respect that have come to a different conclusion than you have in the pharmacology Arena and there yeah and there are scientists who have basically done studies and publish papers in the peer-reviewed literature that say that and is it fair to say that Thursday	 clear consensus is returns you respect that nicotine is pharmacologically addictive Jeff you may not agree with that view but that the that the prevailing View at this point in time is that nicotine has is pharmacologically addictive objective of the question the prevailing View and consensus help words I now know what always talk try to talk English it gets difficult I don't know how to answer	 question why you don't understand consensus either I'm just the phone that question it's argumentative no I'm not an expert in the area of nicotine addiction so I wouldn't feel comfortable and being able to represent that that kind of that kind of opinion if you ask me about specific studies that I'm aware of I can I can be helpful there but I'm not an expert in the area so I can't give that kind of opinion	 I think you've answered if I just want to confirm you are not aware of any studies or test at film ours at Philip Morris while you've been there that have sought to determine whether nicotine in cigarettes is addictive to human beings correct subject to the phone the question	 I think I think I answered the question before but I'm just trying to chill	 stick by my my first day but I just wanted to confirm that you personally never made a request to your superiors that the subject of whether nicotine is addictive and humans should be studied correct object to the form of the question he's personally let me rephrase I will show you you personally never made a request to superiors at Philip Morris if the	 at the weather nicotine is addictive adjuvants	 should be	 studied	 correct just just a jet to the form of the question	 that's fine you checked into the form and you can see and understand that question then you can go ahead and answer it I'm trying I'm trying very hard to could you say it again sure did you ever make a request at Philip Morris anybody that the subject of whether nicotine is addictive inhuman should be studied	 object to the form of the question	 it is in a certain respect that request is has been made and is is basically being of being evaluated in terms of sponsorship of outside outside research and who made that request to number of people	 when what you understand is to win that request was first made all right I can't answer that quickly was that made before you came to the company I believe so was the study actually undertaken when you first before you came to the company there are studies that have been ongoing they're sponsored by Philip Morris which are attempting to under understand the underlying mechanisms that would be associated with with nicotine and Behavioral Systems	 this is as far as I know none of those Studies have been in humans they've all been in non non human situations either and animals or cellular types of work but it's to try to get a technical understanding of what some people say is the underlying cause for why people smoke or why people might want to use nicotine or the allegations that nicotine is addictive	 with those ties honey they were on their way before you came to the company yes	 are the size that you're talking about the have been requested but not yet started on human subjects as far as I'm aware of	 there are no studies underway on human subjects with respect to	 to nicotine addiction question and there haven't been in the past as far as you're aware to correct due to the form of question not on nicotine addiction	 would you agree that nicotine has pharmacological effects just has a physiological effect	 would you say that has strong pharmacological effects object to the form of the question as a pharmacologist would you say that that question has to be put in in in context and in cigarette smoking no	 so you called mild pharmacological effects object to the form a week how would you how would you describe the pharmacological effects of nicotine in cigarettes	 for some effects that would be mild and transient	 with respect to addictiveness of nicotine is it your understanding or your opinion doctor that whether cigarette whether nicotine strike that whether cigarette smoking is addictive behavior has not yet been determined object to the form of the question it's compound you can answer if you can answer it you can if you need clarification it's again it gets into this this question of what we mean by	 my addiction and the fact that I'm not qualified to to address that as a as an expert	 well I've talked about from your experience as a pharmacologist toxicologist is he is a question still unanswered as to whether nicotine has whether cigarette smoking is addictive from that perspective objectively form of the question the term is still undefined we talking about cigarette smoking we talking about nicotine what it was let's talk about cigarette smoking is that question unanswered I think so what about with respect	 - in what and what content pharmacological context was that question unanswered I think so probably toxicology point of view is that question on the answer or you or you could tell me that toxicologists don't consider the question of whether nicotine that they generally don't okay do you look at the dsm-4 as a psychiatric perspective of addiction there for something that's not within your area of experience object to the form of the question	 Ian dsm-4 doesn't discuss addiction	 in terms of dependents does that mean anything to you a distinction between diction and dependents	 again as I said before I read I read the dsba PSM for a while ago it's not really crisp in my mind my recollection is it is written by the American Psychiatric under the sponsorship of the American Psychiatric Society and the world that that they work in is a different world than the one that where I come from so the basis for their conclusions and decisions are different let's stop the tape	 I got about 5 or 10 more minutes 5 minutes probably
