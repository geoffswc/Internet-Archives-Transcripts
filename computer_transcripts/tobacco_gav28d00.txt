hello and welcome I'm Mark Firestone vice president and Associate general counsel of Philip Morris companies here in New York City today we have gathered employees from each of the Philip Morris operating companies they will be serving as your representatives as we talk about the litigation facing the company we're going to bring all of you up to date on some recent developments you may have read about or heard about and we're going to answer your questions about what all this means the Philip Morris and to you the employees,the hearts and souls of this great company our employees are joined today by Chuck wall senior vice president for litigation and Associate general counsel of Philip Morris Chuck is responsible for managing the company's tobacco litigation we also have with us today Steve Parrish Steve is senior vice president and general counsel of Philip Morris USA and in charge of our worldwide Regulatory Affairs Department here in New York, we'll begin with Chuck will start things off Chuck everyone is Philip Morris is committed to developing producing and maintaining world-class products and we are equally committed to a vigorous defense of our rights to produce those products, we have consistently been successful in court because we have followed a simple straightforward course of action, when we are challenged in court we will aggressively defend ourselves, and when government agencies and others attempt to take away our legal rights we will go to court to ensure that we retain those rights, as many of you are aware the company is involved in several areas of litigation that are old extreme importance both to the company and the industry, most of this litigation is in the United States although we are seeing cases in other countries as well, Steve and I will discuss those cases later, in a few important instances the company has filed suit because it has been necessary to vindicate our position, the company is defending itself against those who would impose liability for health problems claimed because by smoking or by exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, there are four general areas we are involved first there are the traditional smoking and health cases involving smokers who seek to impose liability on the industry for diseases which they claim are caused by cigarette smoking, second there are individual environmental tobacco smoke cases, third there are class action cases either involving smoking and health or environmental tobacco smoke and forth there are state government suits claiming damages from the industry in the form of repayment of Medicaid funds expended on behalf of smokers, I should also mention two other categories of cases that we are involved in, Philip Morris has gone to court as a plinky against the ABC television network which falsely claim that we are spiking our products with nicotine, and we have sued the EPA for its arbitrary and capricious classification of environmental tobacco smoke as a human carcinogen, in addition we are involved in a growing number of cases in other countries, in every instance without exception I can say today that the facts and the law are on our side and that I firmly believe we will ultimately prevail, our past experience in litigating these cases teaches us that when all the facts are examined by a jury we win, at the same time each of these cases presents a unique challenge for us and we would like to talk about each area of litigation and then we'll be happy to respond to your questions thanks Chuck Steve why don't you begin with an update on the most recent case that went to trial earlier this year thanks Mark the first area we want to cover some traditional smoking and health case our most recent case the Rogers case just ended in Indianapolis, once again a jury heard all the evidence this trial lasted a full month and when it was over the jury refused to war to damage any damages to the Plano the case was significant because the plaintiff's lawyer attempted to base much of his attack on the so called addiction Theory the plaintiff was the Widow of a local lawyer Richard Rodgers who died from lung cancer at the age of 52 the plaintiff's lawyer claimed that Roger started smoking when he was a child and smoked up to three pack, cigarettes a day after several unsuccessful attempts to stop smoking Rogers quit after a half-hour visit to a hypnotist the Rogers case focused on to claims by the plaintiff first the lawyers tried to persuade the jury that cigarettes are unreasonably dangerous in large part because of their so-called addictive quality, under Indiana Law this type of product liability claim is based on a reasonable consumers expectation of a given product our chief defense to this claim was the affirmative defense of incurred risk or Assumption of risk that is that Rogers new of the claim risks of smoking including addiction yet chose to smoke until he finally quit, much of the facts in support of that defense came from Rogers himself testified in his videotaped deposition that he had known of the risks of smoking since he was a child as an adult he said he took an annual physical that included a chest x-ray because he was concerned about the risks of smoking Additionally the plaintiffs in Rogers sought sought to hold the companies liable on a negligence Theory claiming that the industry should have warned Rogers of the alleged addictive qualities of cigarettes before 1960, when Congress made its first changes to the warning label requirements because Congress mandates the wines the Supreme Court has ruled plaintiffs cannot Sue on the basis of failure to warn of the alleged smoking risks after 1969, the jury and Rogers refused to award damages to the plaintiff and the plaintiffs attorneys have not yet asked the court schedule a second trial, in the past 40 years there have been over 400 cases filed against the industry all of the companies have taken a firm position against settling these cases and in the 23 cases that have gone to trial none has resulted in any damages being paid to a plaintiff yet plaintiffs lawyers continue to try and there are a number of cases on the horizon including one in New Jersey that could come to trial by the end of this year thanks Steve before we turn to the ETS, class action and State Medicaid cases that have been filed against our company and other cigarette manufacturers I'd like Chuck to talk a little bit about how we think these cases have come about thanks Mark we believe that a small organized group of plaintiffs lawyers are behind all of the recent lawsuits these plaintiffs lawyers who have become famous for targeting various Industries such as asbestos are betting they can find, a way to impose liability through the use of exotic legal theories and procedural devices that were never designed for this type of case, one of the vehicles they are using is the class action, in federal courts and many state courts it is possible for a person to sue both on his behalf and on behalf of other people, these class actions are often used in Mass disasters such as oil spills or Airline crashes what we're seeing today is a group of plaintiffs lawyers using the class action device and we believe in properly to Target an entire industry, what's worse the plaintiffs who have cast their Lots with these lawyers probably aren't aware of the enormous fees these lawyers have received in cases where they have been successful in suing other Industries, and at the same time we believe they would be shocked to learn of the relatively tiny amounts awarded to the individual plaintiffs while in some instances plaintiffs lawyers were paid 10 or 20 million dollars or more just by winning a class certification ruling and then forcing a settlement with a group of corporate defendants, at the outset I want to reaffirm this company's commitment in fact the commitment of our entire industry never to settle a case we are in these cases to win, in a sense nothing is new about these cases that seek to impose liability on the companies because they are grounded on the same basic product liability issues on which the previous cases have been litigated, when juries hear the evidence and understand the law they simply do not believe that tobacco companies should be held liable, we have a mass this formidable track record in litigation because the law and the facts are on our side and because we as an industry are committed to fighting every case as long as it takes to prevail, now let me turn to the litigation involving environmental tobacco smoke, we are seeing a number of lawsuits in different parts of the country filed by people who claim they have been injured not from smoking but from breathing cigarette smoke in the air, in Mississippi the owner of a barbershop Who Sold cigarettes in his store has sued we believe this case is being driven by this group of plaintiffs lawyers I have already mentioned, they are using the unfortunate death of this Barber Burrell Butler as a vehicle to seek millions of documents from several tobacco companies, it's difficult to believe that the plaintiffs lawyers are seriously expecting a victory here, to the extent the plaintiffs are planning to rely on statistical risk analysis we believe the proof simply is not there to support their cases, and it was mr. Butler after all who decided to allow smoking in his Barbershop, rather it appears that the plaintiffs lawyers are using this case as a sort of Proving Ground for this type of claim, as well as a Pulpit to launch Media attacks against the industry on the issue of environmental tobacco smoke, in a similar case in Indiana a nurse in a VA Hospital claims her injuries were caused by breathing cigarette smoke from the air in the ward where she work, here too we are seeing the presence of the organized plaintiffs bar and a New Hampshire a young woman has sued on the basis of her breathing the smoke over the years from two dozen of her relatives, ETS cases differ from the traditional smoking and health lawsuits in two important ways first they typically involve a plaintiff who is a nonsmoker, second they seek damages for injuries based on the difficult to prove concept that the plaintiff was exposed over a long period of time to environmental tobacco smoke which plaintiffs alleged cause the injury, we will mount an aggressive factual attack on any purported scientific evidence introduced to show a causal relationship between a plaintiff's exposure to ETS and his or her claimed illness, often even though the cases involve a non-smoking planky there is an issue regarding freedom of choice and the plaintiff is voluntary exposure, obviously we will carefully examine each case to determine whether the plaintiff was able to choose whether he or she was subject to that exposure this is important because the issues of freedom of choice and personal responsibility have a strong resonance with jurors who are reluctant to award damages to plaintiffs who claimed they were damaged as a result of their own choices, we believe there is no reliable scientific evidence Associated ETS with human diseases and we believe it will be very difficult if not impossible for the plaintiffs to meet their burden of proof on this issue we say this because the vast majority of the scientific studies no matter how favorably interpreted by our opponents do not come close to establishing a statistically significant relationship between, ETS exposure and disease in short we believe the proof necessary to support the plaintiffs case simply does not exist thanks very much chuck next we'll talk about class action lawsuits including the much publicized castano case pending in New Orleans Steve the class action lawsuits if perhaps receive the most press attention because plaintiffs attorneys have persuaded the news, idea that these legal actions represent a new wave of tobacco litigation many media reports have also stated that these class actions pose a threat to the companies because of their sheer size of the plaintiffs class into pooled resources of the plaintiffs lawyers as a matter of fact these cases present virtually no new legal issues other than the procedural ones that always accompanied a class action, there are three major class action cases now pending against the tobacco industry these are the castano case in New Orleans and the Engel and Brewing cases in Miami in castano more than 50 plaintiffs lawyers have formed a Consortium they are pooling their assets and each is reportedly paying one hundred thousand dollars a year into their War chest the theory of their case is that the cigarette companies have addicted smokers and therefore everyone who is or was, tendon on nicotine whether living or dead is potentially entitled to money damages from the companies, the castano case has received a great deal of media attention we are optimistic about the outcome and castano for the simple reason that we don't believe the plaintiffs can legally justify a class action the judge in this case conditionally certified in part the castano class but in his ruling he made it clear that no damages could be awarded to a single plan without an individual trial on the crucial issues of injury causation and reliance as well as our, affirmative defenses the very issues that have proved critical to our successes over the years we've asked the judging castano to certify his ruling to the fifth Circuit Court of Appeals which we hope will agree with us that the judge's order is inconsistent with the law and that the case should be decertified in the past few weeks another appeals court the seventh circuit issued a strong opinion analyzing some of the very same issues that are present in castano and that, Court's ruling came down solidly in support of our position while the seventh circuit's ruling is not controlling we think it is very persuasive and we hope it will enhance our position when we argue the castano appeal as we have said all along we believe the law and facts regarding the merits of the case are on our side the core defenses of freedom of choice and Assumption of risk the same defenses we have used successfully in the previous cases are still available to us and castano, not only that because the castano plaintiffs are alleging damages from addiction and not from diseases such as lung cancer they face enormous challenges improving their damages under the judge's ruling the castano plaintiffs face the prospect of pursuing literally millions of individual trials on the issues of causation Reliance injury in fact in Damages and it's critical to point out that they cannot reach this stage unless they Prevail at the trial on the, shoes certified by the judge, the Engel case which is in state court in Florida also involves allegedly nicotine dependent smokers and former smokers the theory of this case is that those smokers who have acquired diseases allegedly caused by addiction to smoking are entitled to money damages virtually everything about this case is strange it is filed in a state court yet purports to be a nationwide class action the judge in the case issued the class certification ruling orally From the Bench apparently without, bothering to draft a written decision ahead of time and the named plaintiffs are a hodgepodge of friends relatives and employees of the plaintiffs attorneys all presuming to represent current and former smokers across the United States, we believe that instead of a group of Representative plaintiffs this group is merely a convenient mix of people thrown together for the purpose of creating the appearance of a broad base class with legitimate legal claims needless to say we are appealing this class certification and we are hopeful the Florida District Court of Appeals will agree that the class should be decertified, the Boeing case is a lawsuit on behalf of all current and former flight attendants who have allegedly become ill as a result of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke their claim is that because they were exposed to ETS in Airplane cabins they have acquired a long list of diseases including lung cancer here to we expect the issues of causation and freedom of choice to play a role in fact individual issues are so important that the judge in Brewing has said, at a ruling like castano the plaintiffs here will face the prospect of perhaps 60,000 individual trials, many of the representative plaintiffs for example chose longer flights over shorter ones during the years when smoking was prohibited on flights of two hours or less this fact alone shows why individual trials could be needed if the plaintiff somehow or successful in making it that far in the litigation, the brain case which is currently on appeal is also pending in state court in Florida in fact both the Brine and Engle cases are the brain Children of the same flamboyant plaintiff's lawyer in Miami it's important to understand the numerous and considerable obstacles that await the plaintiffs lawyers in these cases to Prevail the Engel plaintiffs would have to prove that nicotine is an addictive drug that each plaintiff in the class was actually addicted that the addiction was the legal, cause of their diseases that they did not incur the risk associated with smoking voluntarily that each plaintiff was unaware that it would be difficult to stop smoking and perhaps most important that something the cigarette companies did or did not do or should have done was the cause of each plaintiffs addiction, with regard to each of these three cases the company strongly believes that they do not meet the requirements for a class action, namely there are so many individual issues in each of the cases involving so many individuals that it simply does not make sense to litigate them together thank you Steve that was very informative next let's turn to the area of the State Medicaid lawsuits these are the cases filed by state governments that have also been very much in the news lately Chuck thank you Mark during the last year we have seen four states file suit against the companies, in what amounts to a mass of plains aggregated into one lawsuit, these State officials have claimed that the tobacco companies and not the states should be responsible for paying the medical costs associated with the Medicaid care of smokers these cases have been filed in Florida Mississippi West Virginia and Minnesota, it is possible that we may see similar lawsuits brought by other states as well, in every instance the cases are in the very early preliminary stages and we expect it could well be several years before these cases could come to trial if they come to trial at all, the most recent such filing in Florida perhaps best illustrates why these cases should be viewed primarily as political actions, that case is based on a controversial 1994 state law that imposes almost automatic liability on the companies by preventing them from asserting most of their usual affirmative defenses it's a law that can be used against a broad array of Industries in addition to tobacco, in fact the governor's legal counsel implied at the Press Conference held to announce the suit that Florida's next Target is the alcohol industry, we are strongly contesting the state's theories and are optimistic about the ultimate outcome of these cases, I say this because constitutionally all of our traditional defenses should be available to us in these cases and the state's themselves in addition to selling cigarettes have received billions of dollars from sales and excise taxes that have been imposed on the sale of cigarettes thanks Chuck if we could change gears for a moment I would like for Steve to tell us about cases the company has filed instead, cases where we are the defendants Steve we believe it is becoming increasingly important to take legal actions in court when we believe our rights are being unlawfully restricted or infringe upon last year we filed suit against the ABC television network for broadcasting and newsmagazine program called day one in which ABC alleged that we and other companies are spiking or fortifying our cigarettes with extraneous nicotine, this libel case is now pending in Richmond Virginia and the company is optimistic about our ability to prove that ABC's report was false and that the network knew beforehand that the report was false I can tell you that the information we have obtained from the network so far is very favorable to our position as many of you know American law provides certain legal protections to defendants in libel cases the burden of proof is high but I believe we have the, to win already ABC lawyers have stepped back from the central allegation in the broadcast they are attempting to persuade the judge in the case that the network never alleged that we are spiking our cigarettes with extraneous amounts of nicotine rather they have come into court and said with a straight face that all they said in the broadcast is that Philip Morris removes solubles during the reconstitution process solubles that contain nicotine and that we add them back, the tobacco sheet obviously if that is all the broadcast contained it hardly would have been news, as an aside I want to note a very positive recent development the trial judge in the case is ordered ABC to disclose the identity of the confidential Source it interviewed on the program and upon whom the spiking allegation was based we are now awaiting the judge's decision on ABC's motion to reconsider that ruling but we believe our position is strong it's possible perhaps even likely that ABC will ultimately decide to disobey the judge's order regarding the confidential source, and if that occurs we would have the option of asking the court to enter a judgment in our favor obviously this case is important because the allegations of spiking have found their way into the national conscience and have become yet another instance in which too many people presume we have acted improperly recently r.j. Reynolds has filed its own libel suit against ABC based on the same broadcast, next I'd like to talk about the lawsuit we r.j. Reynolds and others have filed against the Environmental Protection Agency this is another instance in which we believe a federal agency has unlawfully acted against our rights as a corporation, we've alleged in the suit that EPA acted arbitrarily and capriciously in classifying ETS as a human carcinogen and we have asked that a federal judge void that classification the case is now pending in federal court in North Carolina I'm sure many of you recall when the EPA held a news conference to announce its classification of ETS as a human carcinogen as you know EPA made this decision with almost no reliable statistical evidence, the claimed correlation between exposure to ETS and lung cancer is so small as to be statistically insignificant we sue the EPA because this classification is wrong it places ETS in the same category as the most toxic substances known we are confident our evidence will show that the EPA acted arbitrarily and capriciously as you know ETS is completely different and distinguishable from mainstream smoke, although this crucial distinction seem to matter little if at all to the EPA the government lawyers who are defending the EPA have filed a number of procedural motions to delay a trial on the merits we are hopeful that the trial judge will give us a full hearing and will agree with us that ETS cannot be classified as a known human carcinogen mark thank you Steve now finally let's have Chuck bring us up to date on what's happening outside of the United States, chop I want to just mention that the Legal Aid Society in Britain has given preliminary approval for a group of plaintiffs to explore whether they may have legal claims against the companies there this is not an approval for the British lawyers to file suit it is primarily a preliminary step, there is a movement in Finland to allow class action suits of the type in the United States in addition a smoking and health claim has been filed against the Italian cigarette Monopoly and to such claims have recently been filed in Japan against Japan tobacco we are watching for signs of American lawyers shopping for clients perhaps hoping to file some type of product liability action, as you may know most European countries do not have the same type of product liability laws as does the United States so we are less concerned about having to defend these American style lawsuits across Europe, finally I want to mention that a class action against the industry has been filed in Canada although it is much more difficult to maintain a class action under the Canadian legal system we and the other companies are taking this suit very seriously and we plan to mount an aggressive defense there as well thanks very much chuck, I hope this overview of our pending litigation has been helpful I don't want to strongly reaffirm what we have said all along we will defend each of these cases vigorously we believe that we are right on the law and that we are right on the facts and we are optimistic about the ultimate outcome of this litigation, at this point we'd be happy to answer any questions that you may have, Peter hi I'm Peter void from Kraft Foods International, what is meant legally when talking about addiction and what is the company's position for Peter traditionally the plane teased by using the term addiction have hope to overcome our defense of assumption of the risk in other words that smokers well aware of the risks voluntarily choose to smoke and they claimed that by using the term addiction they hope to convey to the jury a sense that there is something about cigarette smoking that prohibits the individual plaintiff, from making that free choice, they don't really go beyond that but juries in the cases that we have tried don't believe in that definition in other words jurors using Common Sense arrived at the conclusion that millions and millions of people have quit smoking, and therefore people including the plaintiffs in the cases have a free choice to quit smoking that's how it's traditionally been used and I think our defense has been very successful because it's based on common sense I'm Jelly Hernandez from Philip Morris Latin America and my question is how can tobacco companies maintain that nicotine is not addictive when pharmaceutical companies are making millions on nicotine patches and gums well let's let's look, get the definition the traditional definition of addiction that has been has been used in the scientific Community for many many years generally the term focuses on the criteria related to does the does the substance affect one's judgment does it affect the ability to make decisions in nicotine the example of nicotine include we know that it clearly does not second does it it does it relate to tolerance in other words do you use more and more of a substance over a period of time, and once again I think the evidence is that that is not the case with nicotine and finally is there a significant medically identifiable withdrawal syndrome associated with the cessation of the use of the product and again I don't think we see significant withdrawal syndromes in cessation of the use of nicotine so I think traditionally nicotine does not fit the definition of addiction so what happened the medical community led by the Surgeon General and the government decided to broaden, definition of addiction and they wanted to include a much much wider definition to Encompass nicotine in cigarettes smoking that rendered the term virtually meaningless because under the definition they have come up with recently we have things like caffeine chocolate and of course we're all familiar with how the term nicotine addiction is used today to Encompass running addiction to TV shows an addiction to everything, the term has become meaningless so our definition of the definition we have looked at in the past I think does not include and has never included nicotine the question on the pharmaceutical companies is I don't know how much money the pharmaceutical companies are making on nicotine gum and nicotine patches I think the real question you have to ask are they successful and I think the evidence is that it doesn't have an appreciable effect on the incidence of cigarette smoking so that's the best answer I can give you and I think it's I think it's an accurate, Victor Franco Miller Brewing company regarding the ABC lawsuit what opportunity that we have to respond to their findings prior to the Airing of the program the day one broadcast I believe indicated that the show worked on that program for over a year in terms of its investigation nevertheless ABC did not contact us and until very near the date that the show actually aired and even though we were contacted very late in the game we did, wide ABC with information about our products and about our manufacturing processes which ABC We Believe chose to ignore hello I'm Lloyd Knox for Kraft Foods the post division in White Plains my question for you is what is the time in on the ABC lawsuit and where do we stand as a corporation the schedule in the case is this the case is now set for trial on September 18th it was moved from June 5th where it had been previously set at the request of ABC so he should, short extension has been granted we are in the middle of Discovery being conducted by both sides we've been asked to produce many many documents as has ABC as Steve said in his remarks I think we're very encouraged by the information we're finding in ABC's files and I think they support our claim that ABC intentionally lied to the American public they knew the facts before the program or should have known the facts and they chose to ignore them, and that broadcast has done incalculable damage to us so we're anxious to get it go ahead with the lawsuit we're ready to get ready to start trial and we intend to be ready on September 18th try the lawsuit and to win a judgment against ABC Elizabeth Claypool Philip Morris management as you look at the litigation collectively is there one single case that the Keystone and can you tell us what it is well there are a lot of cases that have received a lot of media attention, Ian the castano case because of the number of plaintiffs lawyers that are involved and the Medicaid cases of course because they're new and the theories are new but every case is taken very seriously by little by Philip Morris in the litigation team is working on it and that's why we've assembled I think some of the finest lawyers in the country to help us defend these lawsuits every case is important every case is of concern but I think right now obviously the ones, and out for me are the castano case the class actions and the Medicaid cases but we're going to be prepared to defend each and every case that Steve and I have talked about as they come as they're set for trial we're going to defend them and we fully intend to win those cases and to prosecute the EPA and the ETS lawsuits my name is Fargo Whitehead and I work for Miller Brewing Company I'd like to know isn't secondhand smoke harmful and what is the company stand on that, let me tell you what the company's position is that is a fundamental scientific question and in order to answer a scientific question like that you have to look at the scientific data and if you look at the scientific studies that have been done they do not support the claim that environmental tobacco smoke is harmful to non-smokers the EPA looked at 30 studies and of those 30 studies 24 found no statistically significant increase in the risk of lung cancer from being exposed, environmental tobacco smoke that's 80% of the studies EPA itself looked at EPA in doing its risk assessment left out two of the largest studies ever done both of which found no statistically significant increase in the risk of lung cancer from exposure to environmental tobacco smoke one of those was a very large study funded by the National Cancer Institute so our position is if you're going to make scientific judgments you must look at the scientific data that if you look at the scientific data in this instance it does not, support the claim that ETS is a risk to non-smokers part Koffler Philip Morris USA is there a mechanism for feedback from legal to corporate Affairs and if so what kind, well the people in the legal department and our corporate Affairs people are together working together in meetings communicating all the time because it really is on a lot of these issues a joint effort between the legal department in the corporate Affairs people in ddition the worldwide Regulatory Affairs group spends a lot of time working with the corporate Affairs people not only in Philip Morris USA But in Philip Morris International and the corporate Affairs Executives and the legal departments in the operating companies so we're trying to do	 a better job of staying on top of the issues and communicating among ourselves so that our messages to the outside world are better as well I'm Laura pool with Philip Morris USA and my question is we all know that the government profits from excise tax that they place on our products what do they truly hope to gain by bringing the Medicaid cases against us wouldn't it be that if we were to lose they would lose as well it's an excellent question an excellent point that you make	 make the State of Florida for example each year collects hundreds of millions of dollars in excise taxes and sales taxes on Tobacco if you add those figures up that far exceeds the damages that the State of Florida is seeking against us in terms of what the state of Florida attempts to gain out of this the taxpayers of the State of Florida really stand to gain very little if anything the people who really stand to gain by this are the plaintiffs lawyers who work with the governor to draft the	 upon which this lawsuit is based and if the lawsuit were to happen to be successful they would possibly be the only ones to financially benefit as a result of this lawsuit let me just add to that the point about the plaintiffs lawyers they are the ones for Behind These lawsuits and they're the ones behind the class action lawsuit they see an opportunity to gain a lot of money for themselves secondarily for the state are secondarily for some of their clients they are the ones that have gone out and talked to the State Attorney General's	 and asked the State Attorney General's to bring these lawsuits they're the ones that have formed this group of plaintiffs lawyers in castano in New Orleans without any clients really and now I want to bring a class action they're the ones that are behind most of this current litigation	 follow up on that talking about the class action suits what are we doing to make the people who are would be the plaintiffs in that class aware of the fact that it's really their lawyers that are going to benefit from this are we do we have any actions well there's a lot of information out there we're not doing anything specifically in the castano case but I think I think when I read the media these days and when I look at the legislative hearings of the Congressional hearings and much of what is reported in the media	 plaintiffs lawyers I believe the message is getting out not just because from Philip Morris or not just from the tobacco industry but from a lot of places and a lot of companies around this country and some consumers to who have been the victims of class actions who didn't get the kind of money they thought they were going to get from class actions and I think least I've seen more and more of that in the media today as people begin to realize that these class action lawsuits and a lot of litigation are really brought by plaintiffs lawyers without	 Giants and the people who benefit from that type of litigation and eventually cause business and consumers money are the plaintiffs lawyers and I think more and more people are understanding that that's the case and I think they're going to understand even more as more publicity is generated by the Congress and by the media	 my name is Julia Bascom Brooks and I'm with Kraft Foods in White Plains I have two questions the first question is regarding the number of case we've discussed thus far what if any legal protection do we have once these cases are finalized and in particular are there any statute of limitations regarding product liability and the failure to warn well the answer the second part of that question first the answer is yes there are statute limitations which prohibit cases from being brought after a certain period of time	 so to the extent that the statute of limitations has run on many of the claims you don't have to worry about those those claims cannot be brought this first part of your question if we were to lose a case and as I said my remarks I feel very comfortable and optimistic that we are going to continue to win the cases but if we should lose a case we would appeal immediately and we have had a great deal of success in the appellate courts if any of you can remember back that to 1988 the trip alone case was tried	 and part of that was lost Liggett one of the defendants in chip alone had a verdict returned against it that verdict was overturned on appeal so we have had reverses in the trial courts from time to time but we have emerged victorious in the appellate courts so that would be the first thing we would be doing going to the appellate courts and seeking reversal but from time to time it is quite possible any time a case goes to the jury that the case could be lost I feel comfortable that the cases are tapped	 tried and they are tried on a individual by individual basis and that was what Steve was talking about when he was referring to the class actions we have to try them one the time if we eventually have a class certified in these cases I think we're going to come out of those cases with victories I think we're going to win because of the common-sense proposition that juries believe that smokers who are well aware of the claim calculus for cigarette smoking and choose to smoke should not be awarded	 damages in trials for making that choice but if we would lose we would appeal and I think we would be successful on here	 I have a second question what are we doing as an organization to address the negative impact of this litigation on our ability to attract and retain a quality Workforce first of all is Jeff Bible's very fond of saying if you're right and you fight then you win and we are right and we are fighting and it's Chuck says we're going to win and I think as people outside the company understand how committed we are to prevailing in these litigation and Regulatory issues	 that will address part of the concern we're also doing our best to make it clear to everybody in this country and around the world what a strong company Philip Morris is and what's outstanding products that has of what outstanding people we have and another big part of what we're trying to do is things like the employee briefings that we've been conducting in this session today to make our employees understand not only that we're committed to fighting so that will win but opening up a dialogue so that our employees	 these will know not only that we're committed but that we are right on the issues and I think as we go forth with this and we enter into the dialogue with people in the company of our current employees will certainly gain a lot of confidence I think that also helps our ability to attract new people	 I'm Ellen aim from Philip Morris Management Corp what lawsuits are we expecting in addition to Tobacco litigation and can we expect any additional action on liability with our other products well we have had lawsuits filed against some of our involving our other products beer Miller beer company is had suits involving deer where people have claimed that they have gotten drunk and had an accident and then they try to sue the beer company along with the tavern where they may have	 just the beer and we have successfully defended those costumes basically for the same reason that we have successfully defended the smoking and health cases again people are not going to juries are not going to award money damages to people who recognizing that if you drink too much you might get drunk and then go out and injure themselves then seek to collect money damages for doing just that as to the other products I think you've asked you made an excellent point because if for some reason juries would start	 it to hold tobacco companies liable for choices that smokers make what would keep juries from holding other companies liable for products which they made which people freely chose to use such as beef products such as cheese such as products which have fat in them are high in cholesterol I mean it goes on and on and You Begin I think to have see the absurdity of those sorts of lawsuits and I think that gets back to the very point that I have made and then making	 this in this session that juries apply common sense and by and large they they are not going to award money damages for well informed choices which our society permits each of us to make as part of our lifestyle and that's exactly what has been the result in the Tobacco Company cases so I feel that we're not going to have those sorts of cases I think we're going to be able to win the cases and I think if any of them were filed against of our other products on that basis weed windows	 Stu I'm going Purvis on with Local 16 of the bakery confectionery tobacco Workers International Union we represent the production pulleys and the Louisville facility I've got two questions the first one being if we should lose a case saying that debacle area how is the liability divided among the different operating companies in films well the proper defendant in the back of cases is Philip Morris USA the manufacturer	 distributor of the domestic tobacco cigarettes and I think that that would be the focus of the liability and that would be where the liability should in with that company but I want to emphasize the big if there is ever a liability I don't think there's going to be because of the defense we have in the defense's we've been successful using in the past but it focuses and should focus on Philip Morris USA the domestic company that's involved in the manufacture the products	 that are at issue in the litigation you touched on my second question we've got a 40 year winning streak mood of the public seems to be changing I guess because of all the media exposure can we keep it up and we keep on winning I think so and let me emphasize that that is an excellent point you know we do have a lot of media exposure and we have the media constantly taking comments and documents out of context and they don't look for much explanation as Steve talked told you about the ABC incident they had	 their point of view they want to make it in their story when we have gone to the jury's and when we've gone to the quiet and the contemplation of the courtroom where both sides are entitled to present the evidence and to cross-examine the other side's evidence at present their facts and their arguments to juries the juries have come up with a common sense answer and that answer has been in favor of the tobacco companies so while the time the me	 media coverage may be more extensive and we may be hearing more about these issues in the media when it gets to the court room where we do have the rules of evidence and each side is entitled to present his or her case fairly and completely to a jury we have one and I believe that's going to continue Common Sense hasn't changed	 the facts that remain the same and the policies and the arguments and the evidence at is the developed in the courtroom has remained remarkably consistent and I think the record of the 40 years is going to hold for the for the foreseeable future and I think that we are going to maintain a good record in the litigation regarding the lawsuit in Florida Medicaid lawsuit as we all know Florida has allowed the sale of tobacco	 and in fact has acted as a vendor in the sales of that product would we imply state to be a defendant as well as being a plaintiff example that we would bring the disease state in as a defendant but we would certainly use the facts that you have just described as an offset against the states claim and as a defense in the case that after all as we just pointed out earlier the state is making probably making many millions more dollars off the sale of cigarettes and they are being in this continent in the	 Medicaid area so it would be and I think a very effective defense	 in that same lawsuit are we suing the state alone or are we also involving the state agency that's involved well the state is acting through its agencies it's acting through to agent Simmons one of which is unconstitutional and they shouldn't be able to act through it and the other is not authorized to bring the lawsuit which they're seeking to bring so I think they're blocked on both faces but we're not suing the state in the state's name because the state is acting through the agencies we're suing the agencies	 what can Philip Morris do to promote the positive things that we're doing in are we acting proactively yes we're very definitely trying to be more and more proactive and aggressive and promoting the positive things that this company does I think we all recognize that while we have the best brands in consumer products in the world the real strength of this company is in its people so what we're going to do is try to have more of our employees particularly our Executives available to them	 the available to the public to explain the good things that we do as a company around the world and not just in the United States	 you made reference to a few cases that are pending overseas and I was wondering as our International businesses grow do you anticipate more and more legal action against the tobacco is industry overseas but as I pointed out the laws in most of the overseas countries certainly throughout Europe as most of the countries are vastly different to the laws of the United States I don't think there's any doubt that we are the most litigious Society in the world the laws in other countries I don't think provide for that much	 litigation and there are a couple of very good reasons plaintiffs lawyers don't have that great an opportunity to make a lot of money in foreign countries and countries abroad and so forth so you don't see that much that many lawsuits there have been some and there are some that are pending but one was recently tried the last several years it was tried in Finland it's the Ajo case and it was a smoking and health case brought against the Finnish industry we won that case we won that case which was tried interestingly enough as	 most cases abroad would be before a judge three court judge not a jury and those judges arrive at the same conclusion based their opinion on the same evidence that the jury's in this country have been that mr. aho the smoker was well aware of the claimed health risk and voluntarily chose to smoke and therefore he was not entitled to damages I think that theme I think that approach is universal wherever the cases will be tried	 but they're always could be more cases because of an increase in our international business and we're prepared to try those cases	 I'm Gary Adlon Philip Morris Capital with regards to your point that product liability as well as plaintiff lawyers are handled differently internationally and somewhat more favorably than in the u.s. given the hostilities in the u.s. what is the analysis with regards to either moving tobacco company or all of our companies to be domiciled somewhere other than in the u.s. we're Philip Morris as you know has	 long and tradition in the United States it's been here for many many many years and I think that the market this size and the respect this company has in the country and the I think the products that it makes and how well-known there are they are in this country I think it's going to be staying in the United States Philip Morris USA obviously is the domestic tobacco company and it does business in the United States so I would guess although I certainly can't speak on behalf of	 all the management that Philip Morris USA would remain here and I think Philip Morris companies will remain here to if I can just add what we see in our International cigarette Market is that there is a tremendous demand internationally for American blend cigarettes the cigarettes that we make in the United States both for sale here and for export use the finest American Tobacco so I think Chuck's exactly right you'll consent continue to see strong presence for Philip	 in the United States because that's where we are and we rely so much on American Goods to produce the quality products that we make in reference to the class action suits if they were to go to trial and it was decided in our favor is that it for us is the litigation finally closed down the class actions being decided in our favor well having been involved in litigation for 20 years I will never say it's finally over but it would be	 be a significant step in that direction because all the members of the class would have had those issues decided against them and that is some 40 50 60 million people so they would not be permitted to re-litigate the issues that were decided in the class case whether it be addiction manipulation or whatever those issues so while I will not say that the litigation would be over I would say that it would be a significant step in that direction yes	 thank you all very much and thank you Steve and thank you Chuck for your time today	 I want to thank you all for your excellent questions and I hope that we've been able to answer them in the days and months ahead is you read about the litigation or similar matters I want you to feel free to contact chalk or Steve or me or any of our other colleagues in the law department and will do the best to provide you the answers and the information that you're looking for so thank you again I hope to see you
