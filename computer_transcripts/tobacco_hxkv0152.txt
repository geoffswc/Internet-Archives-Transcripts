Lilly you're currently employed by Philip Morris is that correct that's correct and your employer Richmond I'm employed in Richmond yes and, and your position is principal scientist is that correct well my position today is Vice President of Technology assessment as of less than a year ago so you would say you were promoted to that position in 1986 and 1996 august/september yes, who reported to his VP of Technology assessment now I report to dr. Kathy Alice who's senior vice president of research and development, the chain of command a tardy and I assume you are default more is that correct that's correct are you considered to be second in command to Kathy Ellis objections to form, reporting to dr. Ellis are several people none of which in my mind are second in command there's a vice president of process technology a vice president of product technology, a vice president of planning and Business Systems a vice president of research myself who's called vice president of Technology assessment, and I'm a director or group director I may say of, was he call himself it's dr. Carr Churchman I think he calls himself Science and Technology, excuse me that might stir done things recent objection reminds me one housekeeping matter we got to put on the record can we have the usual agreement John that an objection by one Council has adopted by all and thereby avoiding the me to type of sections so it would thank you who's a vice president process technology right now the vice president of process technology is Harold Burnley, who's vice president of product technology vice president product technology is Ron Lively, level-1 that's correct who's vice president for planning Business Systems just recently and you're talking about maybe three weeks Jimmy merical, nyira who is in that position before people I had the Planning Group before Jim came back and he was vice president of Q&A and he returned to our ND then the planning part went to him, who's vice president for research pardon vice president research is Richard Cox, and vice president for technology assessment that's you have that aren't met yeah who is in that position before you I've, I think I've been in the position you know for ever since it was formed, what do you currently do as vice president for technology assessment objections to form we rephrase that what are your responsibilities as vice president for technology assessment my responsibilities are largely to search out and Lead development efforts for technology the company may need five to, years from now, when you say Technologies the company may need 5 to 10 years from now are you talking about the technology the area of cigarette manufacturing design some things there but basically new control systems for manufacturing sensors to do real-time measurements, some of the non conventional products that the company has researched actually things that also might be valuable for p.m. companies in general General Food our craft and the Miller beer paper, how much of your time would you say dr. Lily right now is devoted to products in the cigarette area, very little of my time presently is devoted to the cigarette area, you'd say that's the 10% of your time yes and when did that strike that has that percentage of time spent changed over the years that you've been in Philip Morris well I think early on in my career I did a lot of work with combustion and pyrolysis, and early on filtration, I then have been in mostly new technology for processing, and I've done a lot of work in non conventional cigarette products as opposed to the conventional ones that are normally being so, I won't interrupt your question but just for the record we've been joined by Alpha McDonald he's with the law firm of Arnold & Porter and he is counsel to Philip Morris another matter depending on where the examination goes we may get into areas that are deemed competitively sensitive to Philip Morris
