we're on record Jonathan Chubb representing morons Rosina and Zito, Jennifer Breckenridge from Huygens and Berman I represent the state of Washington in the Washington attorney general action Timothy Butler the farmer hellerman wide makalah Seattle Washington representing Philip Morris in the Washington attorney general's action Jeff while protective pricing roads representing the toolbars defendants in the case formerly known as Arch now known as bonds ship nunnelly and Charles Griffith with honey Williams representing Philip Morris in both the Washington and the, and the Pristina matters and for purposes of the deposition dr. Lilly, Gordon dr. Willy my name is more Jonathan Schell I represent the plaintiffs in the case of certified as a class action known as Barnes at Alverson is a United States back oh I doubt I'm going to be asking you some questions this morning about some of your activities and work that you've done or are doing right now Philip Morris I know that you've been down this road before deposition so you have some familiarity with the process, it all right I want to tell you though that I'm going to assume surf that if you answer a question that I've asked you and you have understood that question if you don't understand the question please by all means ask me to rephrase it or if you didn't hear it ask me to repeat it because I want to make sure that you know we're sort of on the same wavelength is that clear that's Claire yes you need to take just one thing about the introduction you mention that he's been down the path before just so the jury knows he's only been down at once so he's not, at a school door professional witness he's been deposed once before okay thank you Jeff if you need to take a break in any time certainly let your counselor or me know and we'll accommodate you that clear yes I can you realize you're under oath that correctly and has the same force or effect as if you are testifying in court and just for the record if you would say, yes so she can go inside yes sorry yes or no that was the next reminder yes or knows do a lot better for her and taking an Asian range the videographer obviously can pick it up but the court reporter cans well I appreciate that very much it's dr. Lilly you're currently employed by Philip Morris is that correct that's correct and your employer Richmond I'm employed in Richmond yes and, and your position is principal scientist is that correct well my position today is Vice President of Technology assessment as of less than a year ago so you would say you were promoted to that position in 1986 and 1996 august/september yes, who reported to his VP of Technology assessment now I report to dr. Kathy Alice who's senior vice president of research and development, the chain of command a tardy and I assume you are default more is that correct that's correct are you considered to be second in command to Kathy Ellis objections to form, reporting to dr. Ellis are several people none of which in my mind are second in command there's a vice president of process technology a vice president of product technology, a vice president of planning and Business Systems a vice president of research myself who's called vice president of Technology assessment, and I'm a director or group director I may say of, was he call himself it's dr. Carr Churchman I think he calls himself Science and Technology, excuse me that might stir done things recent objection reminds me one housekeeping matter we got to put on the record can we have the usual agreement John that an objection by one Council has adopted by all and thereby avoiding the me to type of sections so it would thank you who's a vice president process technology right now the vice president of process technology is Harold Burnley, who's vice president of product technology vice president product technology is Ron Lively, level-1 that's correct who's vice president for planning Business Systems just recently and you're talking about maybe three weeks Jimmy merical, nyira who is in that position before people I had the Planning Group before Jim came back and he was vice president of Q&A and he returned to our ND then the planning part went to him, who's vice president for research pardon vice president research is Richard Cox, and vice president for technology assessment that's you have that aren't met yeah who is in that position before you I've, I think I've been in the position you know for ever since it was formed, what do you currently do as vice president for technology assessment objections to form we rephrase that what are your responsibilities as vice president for technology assessment my responsibilities are largely to search out and Lead development efforts for technology the company may need five to, years from now, when you say Technologies the company may need 5 to 10 years from now are you talking about the technology the area of cigarette manufacturing design some things there but basically new control systems for manufacturing sensors to do real-time measurements, some of the non conventional products that the company has researched actually things that also might be valuable for p.m. companies in general General Food our craft and the Miller beer paper, how much of your time would you say dr. Lily right now is devoted to products in the cigarette area, very little of my time presently is devoted to the cigarette area, you'd say that's the 10% of your time yes and when did that strike that has that percentage of time spent changed over the years that you've been in Philip Morris well I think early on in my career I did a lot of work with combustion and pyrolysis, and early on filtration, I then have been in mostly new technology for processing, and I've done a lot of work in non conventional cigarette products as opposed to the conventional ones that are normally being so, I won't interrupt your question but just for the record we've been joined by Alpha McDonald he's with the law firm of Arnold & Porter and he is counsel to Philip Morris another matter depending on where the examination goes we may get into areas that are deemed competitively sensitive to Philip Morris I don't know whether the videographer for the court for outside any confidentiality agreements, I think that needs to be done before we get into that I'm prepared to do we can either go off the Record and do it now or if we can have the agreement that at the next break that you'll sign those I think we can just stay on the record and both for the record both videographer and the stenographer are nodding their heads in agreement so I don't see any reason why the record now and I think mrs. Breckenridge okay we'll do that we do that the break go save some time, was there a point in time of your career mr. Lilly that you would say a substantial majority of your time was devoted to advancing mr. I meant doctors who was no it's fine to the area of, cigarette technology objections to form vague depending I think on how broadly you define cigarette technology I think the answer would be yes I spent lots of time studying how the cigarette Works in some detail, I've done a lot of work in pyrolysis and combustion, I've done some work and understanding filtration but kind of far away from actually designing something that might be commercialized back at the understanding stage, are you currently working on, any non conventional cigarette type products, I'm a member of a business team Who's involved in non conventional cigarette products yes, who else is on that team currently a strike tell me when did you when when did you first join that team, my first was a project leader of the of the effort that was that when were you first project leader I was Project leader of the non conventional cigarette effort starting in 1987, and the present product that we were working on this starting in 1988, You're Still project leader for this present project and neck what's the present project to present product project has a code name beta, and what could you describe for the jury that the product that you're working on development, the product is an electric cigarette, and how long have you been working on that project since I can see we started that project and 1988 and it's gradually expanded since that time, it's still the developmental stages it's still in the development of mental stages yes sir there are there any plans to test markets product, there are plans I mean the product has been tested not test marketed where's it been tested as hasn't been consumed by humans tries to form, it's been consumed by employees who are largely part of the project, are they considered the Pol group group are you familiar to turn PLL and Philip Morris yeah I'm familiar with the product opinion Maya Pol know there's been no testing of this product and pol formulas because before you go to the PLL it's tested by employees at the company that the fair to say well I think it's fair to say that for something very new, the people are developing it who are expert in their own mind will do largely a lot of testing and screening I think you go to Pol when you're very close to commercializing a cigarette and you would you wouldn't say right now sir that you're very close to commercializing this cigarette I'd say that we're in the early stages of beginning to test it wider than employees, why is this a considered to be a non conventional cigarette, I'm sorry sorry objecting Foundation, answer, consider to be non-conventional in that way it operates is not in the conventional way that you light it with a match and perform it is heated by the electrical system, does this product deliver tar and nicotine yes sir, and how is tired nicotine delivered to the smoker in this product, where the product is a lighter and a cigarette, and the lighter is about size of a pack of cigarettes, the cigarette comes in the pack it looks like a normal cigarette, one can only smoke the product when the pride when the cigarette is inserted into the lighter so there's no flame involved, it was a smoker takes the cigarette to The Smokers mouth isn't so inserted in the lighter yes sir the lighter, is part and parcel of the cigarette in terms of the way it's smoked certainly part of the overall system of smoking it has to be part of it, John just really feel compelled to do this say two things one is I wonder about the relevance of this product that hadn't been marketed in any period of time involved in this lawsuit but I mean that's that's for later determination but for purposes both of everyone in the room and more importantly for anyone who might later be watching this video tape or might be reading this transcript I just want to make it very clear on the record that this, a matter of extremely high competitive sensitivity of the company and he issues of going beyond what it what it is and concept and talking about design or talking about when the rollout dates might be that's a matter of extreme competitive sensitivity and will need to treat the transcript and video tape in the same way and just to alert everyone in the room that is considered to be that, the entire well I think what we've been doing is working now the whole testimony correct is going to be your Nemesis of arch I would like the whole transfer Mark highly confidential and we will submit specific designations within the African 10 days 14 days and I will say that the board's plaintiffs chip recognize and understand commercials sensitive understand that commercial sensitive nature of this information would treat it as such of course would appreciate that what we do for, Washington we will designate the entire transcript and then decimate the portions of appropriate time frame, and it's whatever agreement we have cover for Cena to write and I'd ask the court reporter in the videographer make sure when you transmit these video tapes and transcripts you send it directly to my personal attention as opposed to anybody else's in the morgue action, dr. Lily is I'm sorry just one thing on that I mean I don't mean to be alarmist about this anyway but frankly depending on how far we go with this it may not even be wise to ship this by FedEx I mean it may be a matter that we want him hand-carried and if we need them hand-carried and the client wants that and will absorb the cost for that are terms of New York whatever you want to do is fine with me I just, make sure I think normally transcripts of depositions get sent here and there and they might go to my office they might go to castano and I want to make sure I don't want to be responsible for that and so I'll do whatever you want but I want the court reporter and videographer to take responsibility to make sure that in the New York action it goes to nobody everything personally, dr. Willy is this product project beta being developed and tested in response to a product introduced by a competitor of Philip Morris's, never mind well I'm in my mind not exactly but in my mind it was related I can explain that if you are I'd like you took when the premier cigarette was introduced which I believe was the fall of 1987 we did respond with a group to form of competitive standpoint and we worked, and we had lots of resources and we work to you know really 7 days a week when they made their announcement, and we worked on things that look like the premier cigarette if you've ever seen that while we were working on that we were having a lot of trouble controlling the temperature of putting a hunter charcoal in the end of a cigarette and trying to control the temperature of the air we put a couple people aside and have then work on a better way to control the temperature which they came back with and said well it's a light day, you should do it with electrical means, and the technology certainly wasn't there at that time in 1987 but they were certainly enough work going on in the world because of the semiconductor industry that it came on very quickly and that looked like the more promising product at the end of the day and so when the premier there weren't looking likes because they were we had patents that were, but when we ran into all kinds of trouble making those we change the project over and we put our resources on this on this product, what in your mind was filled marsden's objective or what is foot was objective from a marketing standpoint in producing this electric cigarette currently called project data objection foundation and speculation, well I'm turning I'm marketing I understand but I'm far from it in front of it, when we started looking at non conventional cigarettes it was actually in 1976 with a very small group of people and the idea at that time Maurice too, make the cigarette more I guess I'll use the term efficient, but efficient meaning that there's a lot of tobacco that doesn't really get used actively in the cigarette, in that regard we we had a small group we had some patents, at the end of the day that never really went very far and became another project called extruded tobacco cigarettes extruded yeah well you mix up grind tobacco up and you extrude it like spaghetti, pre when the RJ Reynolds people read our patents as I understand they started on the premier route and when they announced they were going to introduce Premier our work was strictly competitive at that at that juncture meeting that we wanted a competitive product if they were opening up a new a new area of smoking, at the end of the day the things that I think they made quite clear in many of their things in the late 80s the temperatures lower in these products, which means that the amount of high-temperature compounds that you can form or reduced there tends to be much less sidestream smoke so called in products like this, and I think those those two things actually have driven that type of thing in the industry what is the impact of a lower temperature what is that let me rephrase it, this felt worse striving to develop this cigarette that has a lower temperature than cigarette that a conventional cigarette just objection we talked about it earlier being non conventional I don't know if you want to stay with that description of it are you going to slip into call it cigarette or what but object on that ground okay I understand, each other good you this repeated again that one of the van I'm sorry a little worried about the jury understanding okay, that's you mentioned that achieving a lower heating temperature was something that this product aimed to do is that that's yes that's correct and a controlled temperature I think I said okay what is the why does one or why does folklorist want to achieve a lower heating temperature what is the advantage of that projection is the Philip Morris Foundation speculation, start thinking answer, well if you take a conventional cigarettes which is really paper wrapped around shreds with tobacco, and you lied it you're effectively burning carp and carbon has some funny characteristics that burns at a fairly high temperature it smolders at around 600 degrees centigrade and when you take a puff it goes up into 900 or 1000, and what happens when you when you have high temperature with, thousands of compounds the higher the temperature is the more collisions you can get so-called with those in the more wider variety of things you can form, and so you're always if you're looking for some way to discriminate against the things that happen at very high temperature you would try to do things at a lower temperature meaning that you would eat something rather than combusted so-called and the project beta Heats rather combusts the project beta is designed to heat rather than combust that's correct you said there was a there's a, heating temperature there's more collisions you get in there's a wider variety of things you form and I just want to explore that for a minute what are what are the wider variety of things that you're referring to that you form directions to form, well there they are compounds particularly High molecular weight compounds that cannot form until you get to very high temperatures carbon monoxide in fact by the way goes up very very much as formation with temperature also and so there's at low temperature you tend to get more volatile things and at high temperatures tend to get more, highly aromatic compounds of higher molecular weight now that's a very gross simplification of some chemistry I don't certainly understand no I appreciate that suppose we make it this better you now bitch, you mentioned the the formation of, CO2 at a high temperature what are other Co if I'm put carbon monoxide rather than carbon dioxide what other things are formed at that high temperature, well I'm just following up I'm just trying to elicit more specifics in response to your earlier answer where you said that the world a wide variety of things you form and I've just trying to understand Ward things that are formed, well outstrip my chemistry knowledge very quickly here, there are a lot of aromatic compounds poly aromatic compounds that tend to be formed more at high temperature because as you get down where you've taken almost everything off except some in pure carbon and some hydrogen you tend to form those highly condensed things I mean an analogy comes in support of Nepal and asphalt is something that would be formed at very high temperatures in general, and then some of the gases particularly carbon monoxide I think even nitrogen oxide would be formed at reasonably high temperatures in other words at high temperatures you break down all these things that have a big molecular weight polymers which tobacco is and you get another source of lots of higher molecular weight things, the fair to say the reason why you don't want to have these things present in cigarettes is that they're harmful to human health objection Vegas we need to be more specific about what things you're talking about let's talk about the pah is that you mentioned are they considered to be in your estimation harmful to our particular potentially harmful to human health but me kind of an object based on it, in my opinion that calls for an expert opinion he is not put up in this case as an expert in toxicology chip I appreciate that he is a man that's been a felt warrants for many many years Philip Morris is in the business of manufacturing selling marketing cigarettes and I'm asking him based on his years of experience at filled Mars whether he's an opinion I'm not asking and don't ever got doctor a lily, hold you out here to be an expert in this area because your are not as so tender as an expert but my question remains I'd like an answer and if you don't remember it we could have a court reporter repeat it and also why don't we have it read back again, well let's talk about that you mentioned are they considered to be in your estimation harmful to or potentially harmful to human health excuse me sorry same objection, well obviously I'm not an expert on toxicology or no do I want to be sure but you can certainly read the literature and know that pah is have been targeted by many of the scientific groups in the Health Community isn't it fair to say that's the reason why I thought wires is trying to avoid, the formation of pH is at objection Miss States is prior testimony, what we're trying to do is to number one open up a new category of product one that operates at a lower temperature, and as a if you can accomplish that you can begin to certainly reduce those things that occur at high temperature you can also have something that doesn't, since you're not using very much tobacco set in an ashtray and go in the room, another word side through sidestream smoke and so a lot of the things that socially both customers and the Health Community have certainly pointed out in great detail products that operate at a lower temperatures would tend to make some movement and my words the right direction and the right direction BT less less less risk to human health correct, to form well I don't know I haven't I don't know where they're going to be hazardous to human health or not but you may be able to reduce some of these things which have been found in the literature to pose a risk to human health correct section asked and answered, well there have been there have been certainly Papers written, I'm certainly not not sure I've seen anyone out my exactly the chemistry that goes on but they certainly have been well pointed out in literature pointed out to be hazardous to human health correct correct and the reason why your want to have a cigarette that is heated rather than combusted at high temperatures is because you weren't a attempt to eliminate some of the concerns of the medical community with respect to, rephrase it is it fair to say that your, interested in, heating at lower temperatures to avoid the potentially harmful effects that certain compounds achieve a high temperatures objection asked and answered Foundation, well I think that that Philip Morris in any research lab would if they can use technology to give their customers you know something that could be better for them it's certainly going to happen exactly and that's what you're trying to do it's who what we're trying to do and when you say something better for customers you mean less hazardous to human health right directions to form mistakes is part of, Well we'd also like to give the customer some good taste along with that sure we're going to we're going to talk a little about taste today got the logo right now we're in our we're not focusing on case we're focusing on the fact that salt Mars is trying to produce a cigarette that may be less potentially hazardous to human health isn't that fair to say objection is to form that's the objective data isn't that fair to say Diana and I'd like, I emphasize maybe because I don't know, the company then who would know what Johnson was he says he doesn't know I'm responding to what he does what don't you know objection you said you don't you don't know and I'm following up dr. Lily on what specifically don't you know what I don't know is if if some compounds are reduced and maybe you would do seven or eight of the 5,000 I don't know what the effect on human health is, is reducing the risk of smoking a factor in any way in the development of project beta Justin for his opinion, I'll give you my opinion they were so close with it but Jonathan don't talk to me about patient let's not let's not interfere in every question okay who I'm not asking for your opinion obviously I'm asking for your opinion sure okay, certainly producing a cigarette that lower temperature was something we wanted to do and certainly we want to have a cigarette that had no side strength those were two things we did want to do let me just stop you there and that's because, Philip Morris is, View, hi the combustion high temperatures has potentially negative effect on humans is that fair to say objectively you ask this question that Jonathan probably five times and you've gotten the same answer and I think it's unfair to the witness to keep posing the same question hoping that you'll perhaps get an answer that you like better than the one you've gotten already I think it's time to instruct the witness not to answer the same question that he's answered it three, four times already well we're going to leave this area remove the terrible we're going to leave the series shortly but where, we're going to continue this on inquiry unless you tell them not to answer I want an answer to my question I still haven't gotten when I might have asked them five times Jeff but that doesn't mean I got five answers I got no answer Jonathan at that 1st quarter to repeat the question is very reasonable understandable answer okay well that's your opinion you can have the court reporter read it back please, I would like to look for something up I'm sorry I would also like you while you're looking back to read back prior question prior answer that he gave me the same question, last two questions, question you said you don't know and I'm asking I'm sorry and I'm following up dr. Lily on what specifically don't you no answer what I don't know is if compounds are reduced and maybe you reduced seven or eight above 5000 I don't know what the effect on human health is question is reducing of the risk of smoking a factor in any way, and the development of project beta, I think I hear fairly I think she can't put a paper back and take this down and talk to you let's just answer it it's a yes or no answer I mean we'll move on if we get a yes or no question objective witness lacks confidence that there's no Foundation it assumes facts not in evidence and it's argumentative well Jonathan the point I would make is he prefaced York, by asking about Philip Morris is belief I've ejected a minute ago to that and you said what I want is his opinion, objection as far as part of a member of management at film are you remember management of Philip Morris would you consider that to be a fair characterization your position yes your member manager yes mean it's you have manager responsibility correct correct your senior level executive Philip Morris is that fair to say objection is to perform isn't that fair to say I'm a senior level executive Authority okay can I get an answer to my question, whatever it back, I think it's the one that we've had so we've got to answer it that's the way back to that characterization I think he's answered, is reducing the risk of smoking a factor in any way in the development of the project of beta section asked and answered my objections, sir maybe if we can reduce the risk that the Health Community perceives and smoking by using new technology we certainly are going to do that, thank you does that Propel us out of this area, can you read back as answer this, answer certainly if we can reduce the risk of the Health Community for series by reducing it I'm Sorry by using a new technology we're certainly going to do that, and when you say reduce the risk that the Health Community perceives are you talking about the risk of, disease to humans caused by smoking is that the risk you're referring to, I'm sure I really understand the risk ever they have been compounds targeted which you asked me about her among them poly aromatic hydrocarbons that have been in some way Associated epidemiologically or some way with smoking risk and my answer was if we can Institute a new technology, it's a beta to reduce those compounds and if that carries over to what the Health Community has epidemiologically or otherwise said was a risk of smoking we certainly will do that, as foot Wars to your knowledge sir study the risk that presented itself to humans by the, introduction of pahs in tobacco smoke, I'm not sure whether we've I know we've we've done some things in the house on certainly techniques for measuring pie aromatic hydrocarbons I really think most of the the actual research has been done outside the certainly are company at as far as I can remember why did Philip Morris want to measure, pH is you said that you've done something in house for measuring pH has now asked me why why was for Mars interested in measuring pH has Judge mischaracterizing injection to Foundation, well I think pah is and here I only give you what I can remember sure I think a number of Laboratories and maybe even in other fields that pointed out that they were suspect and in disease and certainly if you're in our business they're not so easy to measure you would want techniques for measuring them and at least have some idea of what the magnitude was, in your product, now that's as I remember and not certainly fact I'm not even sure what the analytical techniques are quite frankly I'm sorry but can you just read this answer back please, answer a number of Laboratories and maybe even in other fields have pointed out that they were suspected and disease and certainly if you're in our business they're not so easy to measure you would want techniques for measuring them and at least have some idea of what the magnitude was in your product now that's as I remember and not certainly in fact I'm not even sure, what and the analytical techniques are quite frankly we just thought I think metalcore report that came across as a suspect until yes it's suspected expected thank you, you mentioned that off Philip Morris in developing project beta was also interested in reducing sidestream smoke because that correct yes that's correct and is it fair to say that the sole reason that Philip Morris is interested in reducing sidestream smoke is for social reasons to action, speculation, I mean sidestream smoke is certainly prevents their consumers, from freely use of the product and lots of areas, so therefore it's fair to say then that reduction sidestream smoke is an objective of felt Mars is for social reasons correct objection, form foundation and Miss States is testimony, I wouldn't say that I know there's a controversy in the Health Community about sidestream smoke I'm not sure all the scientific data is the end that's going to come in on it, but most certainly if we can reduce it in a product we're certainly going to do that also, in a conventional cigarette meaning one that's, burned the Marlboro for example Are there specific formations which are harmful and which Philip Morris did not want, to be formed specific formations objection is to form I'm not sure exactly what you're asking please try again, have you used it are you free the term chemical formulation, sections deform babe, I'm sorry I'm sorry as you know there's going to be some interruptions in this testimony by virtue of objections from your counsel at last he tells you not to answer you were expected to answer the question so when mr. nobley objects speculation of a whatever it's just let's treat it as an interruption and you can just connect a major rules don't breeders and, let's treat it as I'm preserving the record I don't intend it in Interruption I try not to make my injections welcomes all times in a row option but if you remember the question I think you quit you said something about chemical formation are you familiar with that term Cantwell Nation I mean familiar with that term but you know in what context it's fair in the context of the the heating of tobacco at high temperatures, okay are you familiar with chemical formations that are achieved by heating tobacco at high temperatures and you hate tobacco at high temperatures you formed thousands of compounds each of those compounds I mean that's really chemical formation they were not in general compounds tht were in the tobacco okay are there certain compounds that thought Morse in developing beta is seeking	 to eliminate Jonathan I think this is the fifth time that well we we we've talked about pH is but let's talk about whether there are any others well asked and answered and you're asking now for Philip Morris Foundation injection are you a senior level executive film are sir I'm certainly an executive in R&D yes Eric at a senior level a tardy correct that's correct you can answer on behalf of Philip	 - well objection this have the question back	 there are lists of chemicals and smoke that we measure for any product and beta Is Not Unusual in that regard	 and they by the way I don't remember what the 30 or 40 are but they range for some fun things like	 aldehydes and acids to nitrosamine 's and pah has to gas phase things	 I don't like methoprene Benzene at a ray of those things and so that those things are measured in Smoke of cigarettes yes sir in the list you just gave me of chemicals has fought Wars ever studied	 there	 effect on human health injection Foundation Jonathan he's not in that area code like wait wait wait wait	 let's keep the objection since they seem to be numerous today to very tight objection foundation not he's not that area because that to me mr. nunnelee I consider to be blatant Kochi and I don't appreciate it objection Foundation that's all you can answer than every time you miss characterize this witness's testimony to try to get a bigger jury impact I'm going to make an objection II don't have a problem make an objection but I don't like you making objections and then testifying to the fact that he's not in this	 to me that's testimony I would appreciate you not interrupting me when I'm saying something on the record I try not interrupt you you can answer if you remember the question why do we have the question rather I would read back and off the Record Jonathan I will tell you cooperation is a two-way street	 my great but it's not me don't just objection Foundation that's fine I'm probably going to check about attacks on the record directed to me	 I was trying until you have to withdraw it just keep that in mind	 my question was on the list you just gave me of chemical chemicals as Philip Morris ever studied their effect on human health objection excuse me objection Foundation	 it's Philip more steady than my Philip Morris does standard in my knowledge toxicology tests which might mean	 the Ames test for smoke something called the size cytotoxicity test and in many cases in relation test	 I don't know whether Philip Morris has taken individual compounds like I gave examples of and then individual tests rather than in a mixture of smoke and if it feel worse had taken individual compounds and tested them is it fair to say Sir that you would have had knowledge of that as a senior executive at R&D not adulation necessarily like a let's take a five-minute break	 who is the project leader beta now	 Jack Nelson leaves the overall project what would you do if it's our title in connection with this project I'm sorry I thought we were friends	 mr. Nelson report to you about the status of project data no Jack Nelson is in charge of the entire project and what is your role with respect to that project now where my original role was that I was in charge of the project when it started and when lots of the original research was done while in R&D	 Jack is in charge of the project	 as we develop it for commercialization and no he does not report to me he's a product development is that correct he's	 he's a vice president in charge of new business I want to say opportunities but that's the wrong title new business	 new business development I'm sorry	 and is it fair to say that your role well stretched out what is your role currently vis-Ã -vis project beta Texas to form you can answer	 my role now is I'm own a business team led by Jack	 and I generally interface the technical work that's needed to solve technical problems for the project	 was there a mission statement for the project data	 I don't remember whether they was informal Mission and mission statement that was there a predecessor project to project beta	 well there were two when Reynolds first announced the premier product	 in Fall of 87	 we started a program as a direct you know to have a product to compete with Premier we call that Delta	 and we also then had a program we called Sigma which is really the same product as Delta accept	 rather than having a chunk of carbon supplying the heat we developed a heating material based on iron nitride come compound between nitrogen and iron	 that's supplied heat but no carbon monoxide	 and ended up with essentially making rest iron oxide that was called segment	 and was sitting up with a project eventually terminated	 the project went on for a number of years even to building new equipment to make at high speed the	 the sigma / Delta product consists of lots of little pieces of things that you put together almost like a radio rather than a cigarette and was very difficult to make it required a developing a machine that never really ran more than one or two percent efficiency	 and the major problem in those products were controlling the temperature was very hard and either one of them	 and we use tobacco of course and both of them	 and when you can't control the heat transfer	 you can actually set the backhoe on fire and then you've got combustion you've got a regular cigarette that in a very high-tech way to make	 and the idea of beta was to have better control on the temperature which you can do electrically better than you can by heating a piece of charcoal or I not iron I track	 one of the objectives of the sigma project to eliminate carbon monoxide yes and that's because carbon monoxide is unhealthy when inhaled by humans actions to perform and Foundation I think carbon monoxide is generally not going to be and then healthy thing to	 get very much effort	 in the current products of in any current products that's that Philip Morris cells to Consumers is carbon monoxide inhaled by a smoker	 yes	 what was your role in the single project	 I would excuse me I was the overall project leader for Delta Sigma and the research part of beta	 who did you report to as the project leader for those projects	 compound if you just break the answer that's fair but Roger their wealth of change did you report to the same person I report to the same person they were was dr. Ken Houghton	 did you file straight that did you update dr. Houghton through memos about the status of the project a projects and generally I have dated in by going in his office which was two doors from mind talking to him	 who's idea	 was it developed project beta	 if you know Chucky foundation not exactly whose whose idea we had a couple of people who had experimented with electrical ways to eat tobacco even to the extent of the some of them using flash bulbs	 I'm not sure it was anyone idea but they were some people who had worked in the field and I think we all realized the best way you can control temperatures to do it electrically cuz you can control that very well	 excuse me if I asked you this before but	 why is controlling temperature important to Philip Morris	 objection asking answer	 I won't do that with come chip	 you can answer well I think in the in the products like even creamier and certainly our	 are sigma's and deltas	 it was a very narrow plank to walk between actually setting tobacco and fire and actually heating it and a lot of that was the fact that it's very hard to control something like carbon that's burning	 we certainly wanted a product for the temperature was controlled to not get to the seven and eight nine hundred range at normal cigarettes get to why did you want the product to get to the temperature that normal cigarettes get to Jackson asked announcer you Cancer Foundation we wanted to limit the smoke as much as possible in that type of system	 them to the lower temperature more volatile compounds that really at the end of the day of the things that deliver the flavor and stay away from the very high molecular weight things that happen at higher temperature including carbon monoxide by myself	 can you repeat the answer please	 I need that real time which would I need that real time I think	 smoke as much as is possible and that type of system to the lower temperature more volatile compounds that really at the end of the day are the things that deliver the flavor and stay away from the very high molecular weight things that happen at higher temperature including carbon monoxide	 does the project data accomplish the objective of eliminating carbon monoxide	 directions to form get a copy see competences the objective in that	 I think the last day that I've seen that's below 1 mg it does not go away completely	 so it's fair to say right now Philip Morris has the technology available to it to reduce substantially carbon monoxide injection mischaracterizes testimony I'm not trying to characterize test me I'm asked for a few talk about the beta technology carbon monoxide this month	 what are the volatile compounds that you referred to an answer a moment ago that deliver flavor	 are we really giving me into might be accused of being a chemist crunchy but do the best you can lots of volatile compounds come from the breakdown of sugars and in tobacco which happens fairly low and they're things like piercings	 they're all kinds of methyl and ethyl and so forth it tastes like baked bread type of things I'm running very quickly out of my expertise here are these	 obviously naturally occurring compounds correct there's nothing that Philip Morris they're not added as in any sense no they're not added they actually come from the breakdown of the tobacco when you heat it yes sir	 Belton and sigma are no longer existing projects that correct churches to form we have the technology they're not considered as potentially commercial lies the mole as the beta product isn't and that's because of the superior ability and the project beta to control temperature I think that's one of them and the fact that beta turns out to be a whole lot easier to	 if you're going to make it commercially then building high-speed robotic machines with 30 or 40 different stations on them that you had to do with the other products	 what other	 products	 have you been involved in a Philip Morris in the area of non conventional cigarettes	 other than the project beta project Delta project signal	 well was involved in	 in a beta that had more Puffs than than the beta were developing as a talk about second or third generation type of thing	 what is it this electrical cigarette type of device it was the same technology exactly except it had more Puffs the idea being that you could get a	 the tobacco and beta comes in a row you know it's like a roll of paper rather than Bunches of shreds coming at	 and this was packing enough of a roll of this into like a cassette so you had enough Puffs for a whole day rather than 20 cigarettes	 when was this earlier beta project in existence going I just spoke of right	 I believe we started some work on that and like the early 90s Maybe 91-92	 develop got the couple patterns develop something but it's certainly a second generation the after we're putting on there's obviously the first generation	 I asked you to go what projects you were involved in with her cards and unconventional cigarettes I like to now rephrase my question and ask you are there projects that you are aware of in the non conventional cigarette Arena that you were not personally involved in	 okay we have a are you aware of the eclipse project the product from rentals I am but the eclipse project or product is a more recent	 cigarette product by RJ Reynolds it's kind of like the premier in a way but a little different that they don't have aluminum oxide beads a Volta bathroom when this project product	 we had a small group of people looking into a competitive product with that and that work is still going on	 who heads up that effort well yeah the effort is and that presently it started in our Indie makes we headed up with Jerry Whitby who reports to me	 it's now been folded in with the Jack Nelson group so it's reports now food through Jack's group and their needs of this price project that you might expect is called in by a Greek name it's called gamma	 who needs these projects I liked it	 they died do that it was called beta for battery who did that myself and can help the others I don't know	 what's the status right now project down was very much in the research stage prescription what is if you understand what's the marketing objective and project down if you have an understanding as to why felt Mars we want to thank the only clue and when I'm sad	 answer I'll withdraw my question pardon me I'm sorry	 let's answer the I think your answer my previous question is to what the marketing objective was and you can therefore go ahead answer	 the only thing I see and the only thing I've heard talked about is they effectively almost zero sidestream proposition	 and there's a are there the same concerns for reducing side stream with respect to project gamma as there are with respected project beta objection form think that's fair to say yes	 this might be a good time to break for lunch what time is about 12:30 what time would you like to come back I'd say 1/2 hour it's not a matter of housekeeping for the record there's some discussion this morning about having the videographer and the stenographer signed confidentiality agreements for the arch and the	 state of Washington cases that was done at the break those have been signed and notarized and will be kept by the respective Kate case counsel thank you	 good afternoon dr. Willy how are you I'm fine thank you did you prepare for this deposition today the fair to say yes when did you do that	 I spent yesterday with mr. nunnelee and I spent last Friday with mr. nunnelee and David Murphy	 God did you spend all day basically yesterday with mr. nunnelee I think we quit around three I went back to work and I	 did go out play golf no sir and last Friday would you say it was a full full day of activity with mr. Murphy and mr. nunnelee	 I think it's about the same in the court for you hang your head now pardon it again with we quit sometime in the middle of the afternoon did you have your deposition take you to the Fillmore first ABC case yes I did and did you read that deposition transcript in the last month and no I did not read it read it	 prepare for this deposition no sir did you review documents yesterday with mr. not only any documents	 I think I reviewed three or four and the other day with mr. Murphy mr. nunnelee did you review any documents then	 maybe a few very few	 for the same documents reviewed yesterday and is there a strike that for project beta is there a tar specification yeah yes pardon	 it's something under 5 milligrams	 I don't think that there's been any final specification on that product are you track that as Philip Morris aiming for beta to be considered a low tar cigarette I would say that's fair to say it would be a well and ultra low tar cigarettes yellow talking yes	 and when you say ultra low tar do you mean that that that the tar levels are below a certain specified level as determined by the FTC smoking machine yes	 have you been privy and at Philip Morris to any discussions about the reliability of the FTC smoking machine when I say reliability I mean it accurately measures the way Smokers smoke cigarettes	 wow mean it it measures how cigarettes are smoked under very tight protocol meaning fixed volume of Air 35 CCS so I thought was a question has he been privy to conversations is that the question that foot worse okay	 have folks thought Mark discussed that it's not a accurate measurement of the way people smoke cigarettes have you ever been part of a discussion check that to that effect section form and this is yes I mean I think we're familiar that not everyone smokes like the FTC machine	 is there a nicotine specification for product for project beta	 not that I'm familiar with no sir have you been are you familiar with any nicotine's locations for any film art Philip Morris cigarettes	 well I'm certainly familiar in the day Nick case they was a specification for nicotine nicotine remaining in the filler I might say sure and that was to remove 97% of the alkaloids in the filler now you 7% of actually of the nicotine was a specification 97 Plus in fact is that the only instance where you're aware of a nicotine specification that's the only one that I'm familiar with	 is it fair to say that there may be nicotine specifications for other brands of felt Mars makes or has me that you're not familiar with Chuck some speculation I think it would be fair to say that I'm not in the belief familiar with all the specifications	 have you ever read a blend sheet	 detection vague not sure I know what a blend sheet is explicitly okay	 I'll talk to that a few projects that you have been involved in Project Gamma Sigma Theta will you involved at all in Project table	 yes tell me your words what project table was or is	 Mike was is correct	 if we go back a little bit to when we started beta	 which as I said was with a couple people and it gradually got bigger at the time it started looking like it had some potential as a product	 and so let's think maybe starting 90 in 1990	 there was a lot of questions about how we should run that program should it be a separate business should we move it off-site should we develop it as a as a business where it had its own marketing and so forth	 and in that regard there was a group of people put together whose charge was to make recommendations of how to move that program forward watch it be the philosophy and that was called project or called table project table	 what	 this project table a project to develop a certain type of cigarette now I think project table was there's a couple of things it was	 pretty far-ranging discussions about non conventional cigarettes in general	 and in particular it was discussions of how you should best staff resource something that looked like a we might commercialize like the beta program and of course others like I mentioned the one with the more Puffs it earlier version of the beta program that was where I kind of a later second generation type things	 who's the project leader on Project table	 but the actual	 discussion later project later which the parish	 then mr. Parrish is located New York the correct I think so last time I I saw him which was not so long ago	 when did the project table conclude	 I believe it concluded toward the end of 1992	 what was your role in Project able to send you had one well my role was I was a member of the group	 that was to discuss and come back with a recommendation of how to handle the beta program	 the program being the program that we've been discussing this morning yes sir	 what we Mark our first exhibit	 Corporal Market is a lily exhibit 1	 John	 I just like to let it go off the Record	 notice for using highly confidential information this is Breckinridge I don't think is designated as deception and you get off the Record she's not sure if she's ever seen it I do want to preserve our objection to the record in the washing the kids to use this document in his deposition is any other purpose and reiterate that this deposition will be marked highly confidential and accordance with the washing protective order I do want to State for the record that the highly confidential designation was done	 I'm so in a case two years ago Philip Morris versus ABC and it's not in any way stands highly confidential in the barns litigation	 dr. Lily court reporter is put before you it's free market Lily exhibit one that's Bates damp 20 2015 4 466 through 4475 and I they ask you to take a look through this document I'll note for the record that there's a handwriting on this front page it says Willie number 26 and I'll represents you sir	 that this was a document introduced at your deposition of the ABC litigation and marked as in a 26 in that deposition	 yes	 and of course sir I don't expect you to carefully read each and every word in the document because I'll take you to certain sections that we might want to talk about let's turn to the	 first page of this document before I do so do you recognize this document	 I saw parts of this document as you pointed out in the ABC that position I don't remember saying it all intact as part of that do you remember seeing this deposition in the course of your business activities at Philip Morris to do you mean this exhibit yes I'm sorry I thought you said deposition for my exhibit have you	 rephrase it do you recall reading this document during the course of your normal business activities at fault Mars I recall reading parts of this as it was put together as part of I believe getting together a final report in the project table group although it's only part of what that was	 this is only part of a bigger report I remember there was a lot of patent	 patent activity okay and I don't I don't see here but nevertheless I certainly have seen parts of this yes sir were you at all too distracted to you agree way play a role in the drafting of the stock of the objections to form	 well I didn't play a complete roll my part of the document but like I say I did read parts of this my part of the report was a survey of where the technology status of the technology and the product stood	 I certainly recognize parts of this that's correct	 who was this document furnished to as far as you know within Philip Morris	 Perfection Foundation	 I think this was put together as part of pulling together several meetings of the table group	 and I don't know how much of it was given to the entire table group but certainly parts of this was certainly you know discussed that as a final report prior to a verbal report from the table group who was part of the table group	 give you my best memory I may leave someone out they won't consult the time that I understand	 mr. Parrish	 Jim Merkel and myself from our Indy	 Jack Nelson who at that time I think was vice president of planning in New York Carolyn Levy who	 I think was director of planning at that time	 Bob Nikolai	 I think at one time and maybe it was into a Tim Linden who was one of our ended up as one of our attorneys in Asia	 there was one meeting with Danny DeVito tree who at that time was an international vice president and Rye Brook	 and I'm running I'm running short on named I think that was all most if not all Barbara order I'm sorry who was at that time I believed she was a some sort of an assistant to Bill Campbell at that time did Bill Campbell was the president of the company at that time Bill Campbell was the president of Philip Morris USA who actually commissioned the table group	 anyone else you do you recall being part of this project table group what they were a number of people who would come in and talk	 that's all I can remember who would be an official you know member you know what excuse me do you know what year this document was drafted this document was drafted in	 I think oh that's a table group was together	 basically in 1992 and I believe the final report from the group came out either at the end of 92 or early in 93	 this document is you'll see sir on the front page is appears to be a first draft if you look at the cover page of the document says first draft yes we're a my look right in the middle of the page Okay g was there strike that did you read	 so let me just wrap excuse me let me just make it state of objection	 the document says what it says I guess I would move your characterization that it suggests it's a first draft okay I'm just that's we that's fine	 does this appear to you start of the the final report that was issued by the project table group Foundation	 I don't remember saying a final report we did give a verbal talk in which we discussed and know I discussed the technology status there was a discussion of how the project should be organized suggested that would be moved off-site I don't remember I remember being part of that that talk	 and using overheads I don't remember everything what would be called a final final report without graphs on	 were you asked to provide any comments	 in the process of	 this document being drafted	 no certainly asked to provide comments to the group and certainly Barbara order talked to me a lot I'm not sure that I actually actually wrote comments down I talked to Barbara a lot on the phone and particularly about the program where it might go and	 the technology certainly I did a lot of talking to Barbara	 do you have an understanding as to whether other members of the project table group also we're speaking to Barbara at or around the time this report was drafted about this report objection Foundation speculation you know I really don't know I mean I can I know that I talked to her on the phone quite a bit we're you ever and attendance at a meeting where	 the contents of a project table report was discussed Humane as a draft made is that where you're right that this talking for a bit on the table and it was be discussed at the meeting of the project table group before it was actually furnished other individuals within folklore you know I remember	 we talked about what the area is that we should deal with when we came back and gave a verbal report	 I don't remember explicitly being being in a meeting of the group or we talked about this I do remember and I think I even saw a few pages of this from Barbara and I certainly part of what I commented on we're patent things that I don't see in this particular document but I don't remember sitting down around the table with the group and talking	 about this document no sir	 looking on the page that you're the second page of the document for 467 you don't have to worry about that's for the record this is the Bates there was up there I think you're there see there well you're the first day of the first pay your some handwriting on the right side of the document I wonder whether you recognize that handwriting	 I don't recognize it off the top of my head and I'm not sure I recognize that even if it was my own but the answer is to your question is no what do you think our first full sorry the second full paragraph in the document	 actually strike that Gina Who authored this document	 I'm assuming and this is an assumption that Barbara author disc but I couldn't come out and say she did every way assumption and you're not assuming that just because the Barbara Walters name is on the bottom right of the first page of this document and I suppose that that's a high percentage of my assumption yes sir but you have no reason to believe that she did nor through this document production speculation	 I guess I've got the no reason other than the name to believe she authored all of it in fact it wouldn't surprise you she authored it because you were speaking to her on the phone a lot about project table during this period right jack I was speaking and gives me Jessica no more I'm sorry sorry I was speaking to her about the whole program a lot that's that's exactly correct let's go back to the paragraph that	 I was moving a bit ago in the second paragraph it says that quote different people smoke cigarettes for different reasons but the primary reason is to live is to deliver nicotine into their bodies do you see that sent the those two sentences sir yesterday do you agree with those two sentences objection	 I mean I'm not going	 are you asking him	 you asking him as he sits here today does he agree with it to the agree with it some other time maybe more specific in your question sure you want me to be more specific specific about the time frame okay let's let's it actually think your suggestion ship of the questions were very good so we're going to ask both those questions let's first ask the question about how you what was your whether you agree whether you agreed or not at or about the time you	 read this this report do you agree with those sentences and maybe we could break them down we should all be compound question right so let's ask the first sentence has different people smoke cigarettes for different reasons would you agree with that statement objection just want to make clear are you asking whether he agreed with the statement as it was written at this document which assumes that he read it remembers the Trap well he doesn't have to read the document I'm asking	 are you going back to an earlier time so	 okay let's let's let's try it another way	 do you recall reading that the two sentences that I just read to you at or about the time this report was written	 not sure I read them exactly at the time this was written I certainly read them as part of my abc thing okay	 sitting here today do you agree with the state with different people smoke cigarettes for different reasons	 yes I personally agree with that	 see here today do you agree with the next sentence it says but the primary reason is to deliver nicotine to their bodies	 I personally agree that that certainly one of the primary reasons yes	 have you been privy to discussions at Philip Morris where Phil were	 employees of Philip Morris have stated that they did not believe that the primary reason people smoke cigarettes is to deliver nicotine into their bodies directions to form	 have I been in those discussions yes when does discussions take place	 I think we had a lots of those discussions that are about the time we begin working on the v-neck process	 do you recall specific individual at film ours who had the opinion that nicotine was not a primary reason why people smoked nicotine delivery into their bodies was not a primary reason why people spend I think as its asks objectionable but if what you want is people who espouse that view I think to ask me what what their opinion was calls for speculation but if they espouse that view and I think that's what you're interested in	 chips question you can answer that question now I forgot your question I'm sorry I should not be posing your question I just want to let you go the question is phrased by chip was where there are individuals at Philip Morris who espouse of you that people did not smoke	 and rephrase it that people that a primer you start over were there people at felt Mars that espouse a view	 the delivery of nicotine into their into a smoker's body was not a primary reason why people smoke	 yes in fact I was one of us	 who else at Philip Morris the spells that view	 that you know of	 I think there were a number of people who were involved in the process development of art alkaloid reduce tobacco that that felt that was in the major thing	 by the way on the other side they were equally a number of more that espouse the other V	 could you try to be a little more specific for me about the people that held the view as you testified moving to that you did that nicotine was not a primary reason why people smoked I'd like to know some of the names of the people that you recall at Philip Morris that espouse that view where some of the people who were involved in the actual process development were	 Jerry Whitby frano much	 Harold Burnley	 for me to keep going I mean that's that's that's a good sample for right now	 this was a 19 and 86 did you ever	 speak to anyone present you know dr. Don correct yes you know dr. Dunn was a behavioral psychologist is that correct I believe that's correct so you have some recollection of a project called project 1600 in which you were the recipient of certain reports that were issued out of the behavioral Research Center section Foundation	1	600 is that a is that the charge number yeah the charge number smoker psychology series I think it was called yeah I used to get those smokers that costs like I don't remember the charge number okay okay and you knew some of the folks in that group did shh like Carol Levy yes and Frank cullotta yes and Sheree s chori not nourish I will okay and Ginger	 yes did you ever hear anybody and and Frank Ryan you recall Frank Ryan I remember Frank right did you ever hear anyone in the group that I just refer to dr. Dunn's behavioral research group tell you that they did not believe that smokers smoked	 in large measure to deliver nicotine into their bodies	 directions to form I certainly remember	 Bill done and Frank Ryan being very much on the side that that's why people smoked only just up here and that I'm sorry I don't don't interrupt his and Iraq General think I did I interrupt you I'm okay when you start by saying let me stop you there it suggests to me that you interrupted you know we just want to make sure that we didn't go any further but I don't think we interrupted them it's true isn't it dr. Ali that dr. Dunn and dr. Ryan	 we're charged in the company with studying types of things as to why people smoke right section Foundation	 and that was certainly I believe their research area yes and you were charged with the job of determining why people smoke where you know no doubt it dr. Burke and Harold Burnley wasn't neither was he no neither was any of the other individuals that you mentioned a few minutes ago that a spouse view that people don't smoke for nicotine right nope we were charged with building a plant to take it out so it sounds to me like the are the	 that weird be considered those in the know it felt Mars as to why people smoked were spouses of view of the people smoke for nicotine right objection form argumentative answer and that was when I am not sure that psychologists have the total knowledge that Philip Morris those that were stunning those that were charged with studying why people smoke were of the opinion they were smoking for nicotine in large measure	 right objection Foundation speculation right at least a few of them tell me the ones that were charged with studying why people smoke they didn't agree with that theory I guess that things are going foundation and speculation you can answer	 I guess that the ones that I didn't I heard the not one way or the other friend so I'm really not sure what they feel so the only ones that you ever heard from that were charged with studying why people smoke we're telling you that they were smoking that they believe the smokers were smoking for nicotine right direction they were certainly vocal in that regard	 let's go back let's take a two-minute break
