opening in the United States purchased the exclusive use and exclusive of the Bill of Rights, from the national archives for its own advertising purposes 60 million dollars in the next two years, Philip Morris is the principal principal producer of cigarettes in this country which the Surgeon General has said without contradiction kills 390,000 Americans prematurely each year, in the current campaign Philip Morris has entered into a contract not a donation its contract whereby it obtains the right to use the name of a federal agency the National Archives, and that we are told today, the National Archives not only approved the contract but it has approved the advertising in which the National Archives a federal agency which has a repository of the Constitution is a joint sponsor of an ad, which features the Constitution, it has paid Philip Morris has the modern-day equivalent equivalent of 30 pieces of silver silver six hundred thousand dollars the federal cigarette labeling and advertising act prohibits all cigarette advertisement on television and radio and requires a health warning on all cigarette advertisements in the print media both of those laws have been violated here as we will see, they've been full-page ads in the print media without a health warning which feature Philip Morris Philip Morris USA and the Philip Morris logo the feature of the Philip Morris logo which is only on cigarettes cigarettes which are 40% of the market in this country, Philip Morris is synonymous with cigarettes Philip Morris has been conducting a high level for years campaign well financed campaign on smokers rights in the name of Philip Morris, it certainly hasn't escaped that company that had now attaches its name attempts to to the Philip for the Bill of Rights while at Advocates smokers rights and as one of the witnesses who will testify today points on accurately the right that Philip Morris is interested in is the right of addiction perhaps the 11th Amendment to the Bill of Rights, the National Archives is sincere and attempting to enlarge its scope, of it's very more meritorious activities I think that it has been duped in this case, and I think it is being used in an illegal activity clearly an illegal activity in these advertisers not only are they illegal but because of the smoker Rights Campaign, we are making we're offering to Philip Morris respectability which you cannot otherwise get since it is the leading Peddler of drugs which kill drugs at his cigarettes which kill ten times as many hundred times as many as other drugs such as heroin and cocaine this is a critical issue, the Tobacco Company like Philip Morris should be isolated, and identified as a pariah that it really is and it's very unfortunate my opinion, that the National Archives which has the repository as the rights has the exclusive under law to the Constitution that it has cooperated in this manner and I think we should be reminded of what duct Coupe has said in this but the real cost cigarettes, his many times 10 billion dollars the cost of caring for the 390,000 people who are killed and the millions of people who are racked by disease as a result using cigarettes each year in this country, the gentleman from Kansas is recognized thank you mr. chairman the subject of today's hearing the Tobacco Company sponsorship of the exhibits and advertisements commemorating the bicentennial of the Bill of Rights illustrates an unfortunate and a growing Trend in our society that is the increasingly blurred boundary between commercial advertising and journalistic information as that distinction becomes ever harder to detect perhaps by Design we, to be all the more Vigilant and making sure that our present and in my view wholly inadequate restrictions on Tobacco advertising are not evaded for that reason mr. chairman I look forward to the hearings and to you all the points of view represented at today's hearing think only then can we make an informed judgment as to whether any infractions may have occurred, gentleman from Virginia mr. Belcher is recognized for any statement he may have thank you very much mr. chairman today's hearing focuses on two questions first did Philip Morris violate the electronic media ad band five televising a commercial that celebrates the bicentennial of the Bill of Rights and secondly was the Philip Morris contribution to the national archives in any respect on lawful both questions are clearly to be answered in the negative, the electronic media ad ban is found in u.s. code title 15 at section 1335 and it very simply states that after January the 1st 1971 it shall be unlawful to advertise cigarettes on any medium of electronic communication that is subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Communications Commission, I have seen the Philip Morris commercial that promotes the Bill of Rights it has nothing to do with the promotion of cigarettes or any other product it makes no mention of cigarettes and shows no pictures of cigarettes there is no cigarette smoke visible there's no suggestion that anyone should buy or use cigarettes or any other smoking product the add only promotes the Bill of Rights and the American freedoms that the Bill of Rights guarantees, it's clear to me that those who question this ad make no objection to what the ad itself says they merely objective who is saying if this had been sponsored by Colgate-Palmolive we wouldn't be having this hearing today, since the content of the ad itself is unobjectionable it cannot be said to violate the prohibition on advertising in the electronic media likewise I would suggest that the Philip Morris gift to the National Archives is in every respect lawful and in accordance with sound public policy Congress long ago authorized the National Archives to accept and solicit corporate contributions for its activities that Authority is found in 40 for you, code section 20305 using that Authority the National Archives ask for corporate sponsorship of its celebration of the Bill of Rights Philip Morris responded to that solicitation and in doing so I would suggest that it provided a public service the receipt of corporate gifts by public agencies is in fact a time-honored practice American Express largely under wrote the restoration of the Statue of Liberty in association with the u.s. Park Service, for the bicentennial of the US Congress Ameritech under Road a 90-minute television documentary that was aired on PBS more than 20 companies including Philip Morris recently under oath the celebration of the bicentennial of the house Ways and Means Committee and that list goes on and on the contribution by Philip Morris to the National Archives was not only lawful it was in furtherance of a long tradition of American companies joining with US government, cease to celebrate public events rather than criticize that effort I think this committee should congratulate Philip Morris and other companies that provide financial help for these worthwhile Endeavors and I sincerely hope that today's hearing does not discourage Philip Morris and those other companies from further acts of public charity thank you mr. chairman, gentleman from Colorado is recognized I thank the chairman and first of all mr. chairman I'd like to ask permission to submit for the record the statement of mr. McMillan who was here earlier had to leave will be back for part of the recollection I appreciate the opportunity mr. chairman and a great Statesman in his own right Winston Churchill once said that nothing is life is so exhilarating as to be shot at without a result, if this is true that tobacco industry must be feeling terribly satisfied with the actions of this subcommittee but I doubt even Philip Morris could have anticipated the harsh criticism levied upon them for promoting the foundation of the freedoms that all of us enjoy, the 200th anniversary of the Bill of Rights is without question a cause of Celebration and what better way to honor this event than to educate and inform the American people of the importance of this historic document, proof of the sponsor or not that's exactly what's happening, clearly p.m. and tends to benefit from this 660 million dollar Venture they as well as any other company wish to bolster their Public Image but equally evident is a fact that without substantial corporate support the bicentennial celebration would not even be possible perhaps some members of the subcommittee would be willing to make this sacrifice because it corporate logo appears on the promotion I'm mr. chairman I'm not in fact after viewing the ad, I had to Marvel at the creativity other rhetoric which has surrounded this issue I saw neither the Bill of Rights smeared in blood nor roll like a cigarette paper, instead I saw a tribute to America and to a document response for its greatness upon the completion of the spots I imagine a viewing public far more likely to reach for their telephones then for the Marlboros mr. chairman I understand share the your interest in protecting the health of the American people but so too should their rights to protect as long as tobacco is a legal product additional burdens on its sale cannot be justified, as chairman I'd like to quote one sentence I thought was very appropriate from statement of mr. McMillan, he states that at a time when we are witnessing a dramatic breakthroughs for Democratic and open market reform in Poland East Germany Hungary Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union it seems to be a bit for critical on our part to be attacking the free expression of gratitude for the creation of the Bill of Rights 200 years ago in our country, I look forward to the testimony and man the chairman if not for his position last at least for his resolve, you'll bet everything else of a preliminary nature, if not the see the gentleman from Illinois mr. Durbin, and done with Massachusetts mr. Atkins welcome you, to these proceedings mr. Durban we thank you thank you mr. Medallion invitation to be here today I think my colleague mr. Belcher is summed up the law which we face in this hearing and I'm not here and prepared to testify that there is a violation of any FCC regulation or law in the advertising I think that'll be resolved in some other tribunal as it should be but I do believe that we can properly raise questions today as to the propriety of the, the National Archives to choose Philip Morris as the corporate sponsor of this national campaign, the National Archives obviously used its discretion in awarding this contract to Philip Morris the question is subcommittee should ask is what criteria were used the National Archives go beyond the legality of the corporation in making the selection with the National Archives have awarded a similar contract to Exxon as it left Alaska with the oil spill to the Helmsley Palace hotels to casinos in Las Vegas or in Atlantic City, I suspect the National Archives might have pause before naming any of these legal business entities is the corporate sponsor of an effort to dramatize the importance of the Bill of Rights clearly each would have had to been judged by the standard of propriety beyond the standard of legality is it proper really to associate the company chosen with the Treasures of the American Heritage is it appropriate to lend the stature and resources, of the National Archives to the corporate entity which will use its logo and its name in this advertising campaign, I would suggest the subcommittee that a tobacco company in America of 1989 is a very poor choice to showcase the most valued documents in our nation's history Philip Morris is deadly tobacco products kill and crippled thousands of Americans each year their cruel advertising campaigns recruit thousands of American children each day to the addiction of tobacco and nicotine the decision by the National Archives to allow Philip Morris to invade and, our National Treasures is nothing short of defilement with this ad campaign Philip Morris can package its corporate image and it's addictive product in nothing less than our Bill of Rights this decision by the National Archives allows this corporate giant to not only have access to television for the first time since the 1950s but to return in Triumph as a patron of American democracy but beyond the pub positive publicity which Philip Morris seeks is an opportunity to promote their, absurd notion that smokers have some unalienable right not only to kill themselves but to endanger the health and safety of non-smokers around them thanks to the insensitivity and lack of judgment by the National Archives American children will now add the name of mr. Philip Morris to the American Pantheon of Thomas Jefferson and James Madison instead of lifting the image of our sacred Bill of Rights the National Archives has allowed that great document to be defiled by this tobacco giant our bill, rights will survive this indignity with the thousands of Americans who may be won over to tobacco and smoking by this Insidious ad campaign will not it will be little comfort for these new tobacco victims to have a better appreciation of the Bill of Rights as they languish and die from tobacco-related diseases mr. chairman the custodians of the National Archives of let the people of this nation down if we cannot void this agreement with Philip Morris I sincerely hope we can enact whatever laws are necessary to avoid this sort of mesh, little embarrassment in the future, thank you very much stick with an excellent statement, gentleman from Massachusetts mr. Atkins is Wrecking thank you mr. chairman and my special thanks to you and the ranking minority member mr. Whitaker for this timely hearing on this lease of Our National Heritage and our National Treasures to the Philip Morris Corporation, this week marks the Great American smokeout a time when thousands and thousands of our citizens attempt to give up smoking I wish them luck I can attest to the struggle and breaking the cigarette addiction I know it can be one of the most painful and trying periods in a person's life nine years ago my wife Korie a three pack a day smoker quit cold turkey, the first days and weeks of nicotine withdrawal we're almost unbearable for her the following months were filled with temptation I'm proud to say that Cory one the most difficult Battle of her life and it's not had a cigarette in over nine years I remember vividly the last time she was tempted to light up a cigarette I had just been sworn in to Congress in 1985 and the White House had a dinner for freshmen members at each place setting was an, again silver dish with a half-dozen cigarettes for my wife it was a reminder of the momentary pleasures of smoking this pre surgeon general's report practice served me in every freshman member of Congress would notice of the subtle and not-so-subtle web of influence spawned by the cigarette industry in Washington when my wife contacted the protocol office in the white house she was gently reminded of, of the numerous contributions made by the cigarette industry to refurbishing the White House the Philip Morris National Archives Arrangement is the latest largest and most egregious cigarette industry Gambit in recent times it follows a conspicuous pattern by the cigarette firms to buy friends and win respectability in high government offices cigarette manufacturers donated over a million dollars to refurbish the state, Apartments treaty room a small thank you for the extraordinary effort put forth by the state department to dramatically increase cigarette exports worldwide this year the cigarette industry hosted a party in honor of the former US trade representative and current Secretary of Agriculture after his service and opening export markets and expanding advertising rights in South Korea Taiwan and Japan, now for the Bargain Basement price of six hundred thousand dollars cigarette advertisements are back on television I'm not surprised by the latest cigarette industry investment six hundred thousand dollars is a cheap price to pay to circumvent the law the industry finds ways to replace the 400,000 lifelong customers who die each year from smoking however I'm baffled by the decision of the National Archives to open a, Dora's box and bringing cigarette advertisements back on television they've cheapened and shamed the Bill of Rights using it as a cheap parchment fig Leaf of respectability for Philip Morris has efforts to a dick new people to their products it is a national embarrassment for the Bill of Rights to appear on television side by side with a smoking industry that has been banned from the airwaves since 1971 the National Archives, it's believes that there's a difference between Phillips Philip Morris the corporation and Philip Morris the smoking company frankly the difference is lost on me and I would bet on most Americans I think the lure of a six hundred thousand dollar donation and a 30 million dollar ad campaign has clouded their judgment the memorandum of understanding between the archives and Philip Morris raises more questions than it answers I hope during their testimony the archives clarifies the, mint and specifically explains who controls the mailing list generated by this altruistic campaign what guarantees does the archives have that these lists won't be used for mailing cigarette promotions free samples and coupons perhaps the archives can explain what it means in the memorandum of understanding when they suggest that the National Archives will use its best efforts to assist Philip Morris and securing any, mission that may be required for it to use the voices of leading Americans including former American presidents in connection with a Philip Morris National Archives public service announcements shocking to me at a time when we're seeing the airwaves filled with people making commercial promotions that we're now going to use our deceased presidents to try to push the Philip Morris Corporation, today I join with millions of Americans who are desperately trying to break their lifelong addiction to nicotine during the week of the Great American smokeout to say shame on the national archives for leasing our Bill of Rights like a pack of Rolling Papers shame in the national archives for bringing cigarette advertisements back and television into the thousands of Americans who are trying to break their addiction to cigarettes during the Great American smokeout I wish you the best of luck, hope during those first tough days of withdrawal and Temptation you persevere when you see the ad for Philip Morris and the national archives please know that not everyone in Washington wants you to fail once again thank you mr. chairman for convening this hearing, thank you very much mr. Durbin and mr. Atkins, I was reading a article, last year from Wall Street Journal this morning, discuss the Strategic philanthropy of Philip Morris, and in discussing it some length that mentioned the various art galleries mentions that Philip Morris has emphasized the Arts in its campaign obviously because it thereby becomes close to many people who are also close to decision makers gives all kinds of parties for our church groups and one of those involved in the Arts, quit but apparently very seriously when asked about accepting money from Philip Morris we would accept money from the mafia if they offered us response and I think that's a serious question, because the mafia is also involved times with some legitimate business interest as the Philip Morris Day, but the other thing I'd like to observe is that those in the anti-smoking movement have been observing for quite some time but the problem was cigarette advertising is it it never mentioned cigarettes, it mentions Blue Sky horses healthful people on beaches on skis and maybe occasionally a brand name or a logo but often just a slogan we've come a long way baby, go to where the flavor is go tomorrow Bergman and I'm amazed that this authors of that kind of advertising on the basis of slogan and never admitting what they're really selling now say that this is not a cigarette ad because it doesn't mention cigarettes or smoking most of their ads don't mention cigarettes or smoking and they are commercials for the purpose of advertising cigarettes, that's where I think we've got off here in responding to a question about the law I'll conclude at this point on this I think we've got off base a little bit in thinking that cigarette advertisements must show a pack of cigarettes or must mention smoking or must show somebody lining up the cigarette companies never do that because they never admit that's what they're really advocate, I've nothing further yes German I exhale I thank the witnesses and appreciate the very very excellent well-thought-out testimony both are witnesses presented, John from thank you very much mr. chairman I recognize and applaud the conviction that my colleagues have I know their cause is well-intentioned I simply disagree with their conclusions let me ask if either of you have any objection to the text of the Philip Morris Ed itself there anything in the text of the ad that you object to I've only seen it once it's a beautiful a, until the end and at the end of course it throws on the Philip Morris logo and the name of the company and I think at that point it turns the whole advertisement as far as I'm concerned into something which is not a source of Pride to me as an American do you think that the mirror showing of That logo is going to convince Americans zombie like to proceed to the nearest tobacco store and buy a pack of cigarettes is well I have to go along with with chairman said earlier it is amazing the type of subliminal and in, direct advertising that is used by this industry they cannot in good conscience or with a straight face I should say with a straight face say to the American people take up smoking it's good for you it makes you look good and healthy and it's just great for your lungs and your teeth they wouldn't dare do that what they try to do is to come at it from so many different directions I think the chairman is Right a portraying athletes sitting in locker rooms as smoking a cigarette after they've worked out you've seen that billboard I think we've all seen it women who look fashionable and, with cigarettes Yuppie scenes and living rooms never in any of those ads do you see let's take up smoking very few of them do you see a cigarette itself they try to do this in directly and subliminally and I think that's what they're about here let's legitimize ourselves let's make ourselves sound like we're important American citizens with good connections nowhere is that how well I'm sorry Chester did if I could just respond to that it's not the text of the ad that troubles me it's the context and what you have, and I think it's very clear that Philip Morris didn't spend no isn't spending 30 million dollars just for an altruistic effort but what they're really trying to do is promote as part of the bicentennial of the Bill of Rights to promote the most massive campaign for the right to die in this country and that's really what they're talking about because the right to die is indeed a part of the right to smoke because, the inevitable result for the vast majority of smokers and what they're trying to do was is cloud over an obscure the issues of health and to try to put it as a separate issue that as a smoker if you want to kill yourself you've got the right I don't think anybody anybody would disagree with that well I people people do have that right but I don't, I do object to using the National Archives to go in and secure permission to use President Kennedy's Voice or President Roosevelt's Voice or other people's voices to help in that effort Chester you would agree would you not that nowhere in the ad is a cigarette visible, correct that's correct well we're in the ad is smoking mentioned in any way correct that's correct nowhere in the ad is a person told of the advantages of smoking or encouraged to smoke correct nowhere in the ad is any smoke visible correct it's correct in fact the text of the ad is entirely unobjectionable and if American Express which has sponsored other publicly related projects particularly one in association with the u.s. park, and sponsored this ad you would not be here today objecting would you it I would not be objecting as strenuously but I think the concept of obvious fact the objecting at all of America's I would because I want why what what I would have ject to is the memorandum of understanding if the memorandum of understanding were the same as the one with the National Archives the memorandum of understanding is to me and deeply troubling and particularly when they, I'll refer you know companies spend enormous sums of money to get famous people and celebrities on for their product dads and the new their various forms and subtle forms that people are going to and what Philip Morris is indeed enlisted is the National Archives best efforts to secure essentially our deceased presidents as part of this promotional campaign for them and I would point out that, to suggest that the Bill of Rights promotional at Philip Morris is putting on is not an advertisement for Philip Morris would be very similar to suggesting that the Infiniti ads are not ads for automobiles the fact of the matter is that this is the new subtle, understated subliminal form of advertising and it's extraordinarily effective and indeed they needed and they need that investment because they lose 400,000 of the best customers every single year to death well if I understand your answer you are saying that you would object to this ad no matter who the sponsor and association with the National Archives is whether it be Philip Morris or American Express you would have objections to this kind of advertising and that I would object if I could clarify would have, Jack to any Corporation having a memorandum of understanding which allowed them to enlist national archives in securing essentially the services former American Presidents to do promotionals for them I further particularly object because this is not a benign or a necessary industry this is an unnecessary and lethal industry that, happens to be sponsoring these ads you're not suggesting that there was anything unlawful in the National Archives having solicited and accepted this contribution are you could I respond to that please I think that there's a serious question as to whether this ought to be a matter of public policy that we in fact enlist these corporate sponsors I think that's deserving of debate in this chamber and I know the budget squeeze that we're facing causes many agencies to look to other sources and I assume the National Archives felt that they were in that position but I have to ask, answer the gentleman with the question does the gentleman think that as long as a business entity is legal in America that they should be entitled to this type of corporate sponsorship with the gentleman want to see the casinos of Atlantic City advertising our Bill of Rights for example I have absolutely no problem with the advertisement and whatever way is appropriate of a lawful product to answer your question but let me suggest that we have a long and time-honored practice in the United States of allowing Corporate America to, operate with public agencies in order to advertise public events celebrations of past occurrences and the like we have had a large number of companies Philip Morris included co-sponsor events with this Berry Congress in fact the bicentennial of the US Congress was co-sponsored by more than 20 different corporations including Philip Morris when the house Ways and Means Committee had its Bicentennial celebration during this Congress Philip Morris and others, eight contributions to that it was that wrong are you saying that all corporations should be prohibited from joining with public agencies to celebrate what is a public event worthy of Celebration by all I would just say let's make one exception let's pick a corporation that sells a product that kills the largest number of Americans from a preventable cause of death let's try to exclude them and say we'll put them in a little different category this is not a run-of-the-mill business this is a business which is legal yes selling a product that is lethal it is killing, thousand Americans a year that's what makes the difference and I am embarrassed to as a member of Congress by the pervasive presence of tobacco companies on Capitol Hill and you see them everywhere you can't have an event I have a 4H event from my district they bring in some of the nicest young kids in the world to an event that's being co-sponsored by a tobacco company I thought one of the Ages was health and obviously they're not paying any attention to it they're taking the money and running we do it to as members of Congress the National Archives, done it here I think it's wrong in every instance let me if I could suggest and I just like to Echo my colleague mr. Durbin's remarks from earlier I don't think that this is the Forum and that we are the people to cast judgment on the legality of this particular arrangement I think what we're calling into judgment into question is the Judgment of the national archives in embarking on this project and, also their judgement in signing this particular memorandum of understanding I think one of the things and what I tried to point out in my statement as from the first time I set foot in the Congress in 1985 I have been absolutely bombarded by the largesse of the cigarette industry and whether it was that silver cup at the White House with the free cigarettes, Senate whether it is you know as Dick Durbin mentioned the 4-H people who were here and you know who are sponsored by the cigarette companies and the cigarette companies have got their photographers there to get a picture of you with your constituents whether it's their sponsorship as you mentioned the bicentennial of the Congress and so forth there every place with an open checkbook and it creates an enormous problem, when we have as a national policy trying to do everything that we can to reduce without violating people's rights to reduce smoking behaviors that increasingly is we're faced with a budget squeeze we have this question of you know turning in the open checkbook of the large cigarette companies and that certainly creates an appearance, of a conflict if not the actuality the conflict in virtually all aspects of our government and I think what's happened is that a practice practice of corporate sponsorship of public entities and public activities which may be troubling to people and I think has been troubling to many of us for a period of time that when the National Archives jumped into bed with Philip Morris that was finally went way over the line and that what went, May sort of troubling practice became something that I think is just totally out of bounds well my time is expired let me simply say thank you well mr. chairman I have one concluding statements make and let me thank both of these Witnesses for appearing here today and I commend again the sincerity with which they bring these views to the subcommittee I simply disagree with their conclusions we have a history that goes back to the 1940s of having Corporate America assist public agencies and, sponsoring public events we have not made sufficient public monies available for the sponsorship of those events and for mailing out things like copies of the Bill of Rights and I think it's very commendable that corporations in this country are willing to help with those projects and I'll repeat what I said in the opening statement and that is that I very much hope that this hearing does not chill their willingness to do so in the future thank you mr. Belvedere I'll be glad to you the gentleman has reiterated the question and, yes the witness is about to question of whether smoking or cigarettes are mentioned I'd like to repeat first that the best cigarette ads are those which do not mention cigarettes which do not mention smoking which shown either or any of the foregoing and I might add here's a magazine article that shows some of the development back in the 1950s there's the Marlboro Man smoking a cigarette actually spoke, Langley you can see the smoke here in the 1980s we have the Marlboro Man just the name and he's on a horse and some of them he doesn't have a cigarette as I would fall but having made that point not to reiterate this it is not accurate to say that this does not these ads don't show a identification of a cigarette the logo is very clear you have one there at the table the logo under over Philip Morris company	 is the escutcheon or the coat of arms or whatever which says p.m. on it and this is the logo that's on Philip more cigarettes namely Marlboro Marlboro sells 25% of the cigarettes in this country and it has that logo very plainly on it	 that's not subliminal own my book but if it is it's very effective it this is an ad right here this is a tobacco ad for cigarettes they don't have this p.m. and the escutcheon on Kraft Foods or caramel's we checked that this is only on cigarettes this is a cigarette ad and so identified as the cigarette ad by reason of the fact that says Philip Morris USA which is a cigarette company and it also shows the logo which is	 all of their cigarettes well reclaiming my time for a moment mr. chairman I would point out that in all of the real cigarette advertisements that you demonstrated their there was some reference at least to the brand if not a picture directly of the package or if someone holding the cigarette and some reference is to judge the second factor is not sufficient in my view mr. chairman it is not because the law doesn't identify I'm sorry to interrupt but I'm incredulous the logo in my view could never	 be interpreted as an advertisement for the product itself the mere presence the logo is is not that kind of advertisement in all of the jello realize that's on all of their cigarettes bar would be if the chair doesn't mind I do believe this member controls the time for now I'll be happy to yield back in a moment but let me suggest to you that in all of the advertisements that you were showing by way of analogy there was some reference to the package there was some reference to the brand itself or some visual representation of	 a cigarette or smoking that is clearly not the case in the atom question	 those were examples I showed that the gentleman is familiar with the ads such as we've come a long way baby and come to where the flavor is others where we just have blue skies and others where we have just the all of the person on them and make some reference to the product itself and and this large not subliminal Lar	 logo which is only on cigarettes produced by Philip Morris companies which says p.m. on it is clearly an advertisement for cigarettes produced by Philip Morris namely Marlborough and I'd like to ask the gentleman if you think that there is a large body of the public who are aware the Marlboro cigarettes are produced by Philip Morris	 mr. chairman I would yield for just a second Charlie I would observe that I don't know who makes who in this business okay I don't know what company makes what cigarettes and I was just wondering just to help some of us that aren't as deeply involved in this issue as a chairman is but care about it could the staff run the ads that were talking about is the staff have the ads here that we would well we we have the I'd like to have it here what we are	 talking about back at the ad but I'm not talking about you add that supposedly been running on television just earlier it was good could you run it again for those of us who were detained at an earlier meeting than didn't have the opportunity to see it but that objection will run again and then we should we didn't see it William see the admin okay okay I'd like to show you the Amazon a television show this morning where it was run that's what I'm thinking of pardon me and I knew we were	 to run it so we'll run it	 that's not true	 to say what we want to express our individuality and divorced and it's insured by this document join us and the national archives in celebrating the 200th anniversary of the Bill of Rights	 mr. Rolando who's controlling the time Business Report is brought to you by the gentlemen's down lifting Virginia's control them mr. chairman I yield back the balance of my time gentlemen	 from Colorado is recognized I appreciate that mr. chairman that's about the 14th time I see Ned first of all I didn't understand why I thought I'd see this well I appreciate the gentleman's certainly commitment on this particular issue I would also say however that probably we would have looked a little bit further we could have found a couple other gentleman who are members of this Congress who would probably have opposing views	 should have been here this morning as well and I would just like to associate my feelings and policies with the gentleman voucher that when you look at this particular ad I think it's doing a lot more than advertising tobacco Philip Morris companies companies was the logo and they have many more Holdings outside of	 backhoe for example only forty percent of their sales are in fact 60% are in other areas Kraft Foods cetera and and I think this distinction has to be made that we are not talking about the back way appetizers particular the talking about a company that has many companies that have other Holdings other than cigarettes and I think this is a very important	 thank you but bring out when we start talking about whether or not this is a violation of any particular loss as they do have Holdings in tobacco as well and mr. chairman I do not have any questions of the two gentlemen except I'd Sue certainly respect their opinions their philosophies in this and yield back the balance of my time the gentleman from Kansas is recognized if I might interject the ad that I was speaking I was not the	 television ad although it has the same logo on it smaller on the TV but page ad in the which you have a reduced version of you but here's the full size them and note the logo and full-page ad in the newspapers thank you mr. chairman first let me say that I'm very sympathetic with the two colleagues that are testifying before the committee today and I have supported them in much of their efforts to raise public awareness in this country as to the danger and unique	 danger cigarette smoking and I've supported the bands on airline smoking and that sort of thing and have legislation of my own that would change the label warning on cigarette packs to make it very specific that and and require that we label packs to say that according to the Surgeon General nicotine is an addictive drug and I would like to see us move that legislation at some time I mr. chairman I would also observe that I have seen this	 this commercial that we just saw a number of times and I hate to disappoint the the Ad Agency that may have prepared this advertisement with the idea of somehow helping fill up more sell more cigarettes because I have to tell you I did not know who was sponsoring that commercial and I've seen it a number of times I thoroughly enjoyed it and I thought I was a very powerful commercial but I had no idea I did not remember do who sponsored the ad and I think	 that there's some legitimate questions that the gentlemen are raising and one of them that I would like to have a little bit more information terms in your own thinking on is do you feel like that any company as you know as you know Philip Morris owns a Miller Brewing Company I believe and they own craft General food I'm just curious on that sort of a commercial now had they said they said this is brought to you by craft General Foods Miller Brewing Company by the way	 the hall is also an addictive drug that producers of that bring us a lot of things in terms of Television that opens this whole question up as to how far are we going to take the sort of commercial limitation of free speech I'm just curious if they had said that this is brought to you by Kraft General Foods Miller Brewing Company and in finer print Philip Morris would that have been as offensive to you as this is this particular commercial	 shal was how are we going to deal with this any company out there that has any sort of tobacco or cigarette interest of any kind are they going to be banned from doing this sort of of advertising is that what we want to do is that what you're suggesting or is it just because they said Philip Morris and I have to tell you also and I hate to disappoint the advertisers Phillip Morris you know I bet if you took a poll of the American people today and ask people in this country you know what Philip Morris does	 be disappointed to realize how few people in this country understand that Philip Morris does cigarettes manufacturer cigarettes I don't know but I'm just curious how far do you want to take let me let me just suggest that I think the one group of people who really would and know precisely what Philip Morris does in the cigarette industry or smokers and I love people that haven't I'm more concerned about people that haven't made the choice to start smoking those are the people I think we really need to be focused	 let me start from moment before I get into that that what what happens and you understand that we're talking about an addictive as you mention an addictive drug here one of the things and one of the clear patterns and addiction is that it takes a small thing as a trigger	 to unleash in the brain the desire for the addicted substance particularly after you've quit until you for my wife quit nine years ago give you an idea of how powerful is thing is somebody once asked to what would you do if there was an announcement that some kind of warning that there was an imminent nuclear strike that was going to take place by a pack of cigarettes and smoke	 it's that strong a hold and what happens is that little logo which may seem like nothing to you is a very clear behavioral trigger for people people starting to smoke young people who have just picked it up the second thing is that what's happened jet let me make sure I understand what you're saying you're suggesting then that just the the mere sight of that of that Crest or whatever you want to call it triggers an emotional response in the watching public on	 Vision among lying public that that stimulates that desire to buy a pack of cigarettes and that among it among addicted smokers which is why you notice in all these cigarette packs it's always there it's why they put it there they don't just put Philip Morris they put that little Crest and it is a trigger for people with visual their cigarettes I think fine I don't think they do that all the time I mean I have got I have ice it was Parliament made by Philip Morris I don't know is it well the major ones Barbara was a chief or principal	 of the market it's about 40% of more than that it's about the next sixty percent of the Philip Market with Philip Morris puts out in 24 percent of the market reclaiming my time mr. chairman I have before me a merit back and a Cambridge pactum are attack has it apparently in a small letters the Cambridge back does not so your point though is that it's they have these pressed on their to trigger	 response and in fact it trigger that's on this this type of television commercial is going to stimulate that sort of an emotion it's on said that's part of it and that's the I think pretty clear scientific evidence in terms of studies of addiction way these things work which is why they put so much money into emphasizing that logo and and advertising it so let me ask you all do sing it let me ask you this then I'm just curious do you think that in this situation that we should	 Kevin craft General foods and Miller Brewing Company from from participating in this sort of advertising also what does they are part of Philip Morse what what I'm suggesting is that the memorandum of understanding that was entered into between the national archives and Records Administration and the Philip Morris Corporation while I'm not aware that it violates any	 a law of this country I think is incredibly bad judgment would be bad judgment for Philip Morris would be bad judgment Ford Motor Company whatever the National Archives Bill of Rights that document down there the records that they have the voices of past presidents that's our American Heritage that belongs to all of us to sell for six hundred thousand dollars which is excuse me they didn't sell they least	 to lease the use of that to lease those visual images which are not available in those ways to lease those voice tracks and so forth that they have they did that for Philip Morris and Philip Morris alone because of the memorandum of understanding that they entered into and what that does in the importance of that and the reason that Philip Morris is spending 30 million dollars for that	 is it's buying for the cigarette companies respectability and it's buying them back into the mainstream that because of the efforts	 this subcommittee and of others in the Congress and of people in the health profession the American Cancer Society and the American Medical Association and on and on people have identified nicotine is an addictive drug then if I'd smoking is something that has had enormous adverse consequences on our society and to be able to come back in and we're all politicians and we understand that you get into trouble in these kinds of things what are the adverse	 ties in consultants and girls tell you to do Wrap yourself around one of our national symbols and they've taken the Bill of Rights at a time that their product that product cigarettes are killing close to 400	000 people a year that they're under an assault as they've never been before that the force	 outside of the mainstream of Commerce they come in with 30 million dollars and with having purchased the support of the national archives for the right to wrap themselves around the parchment of the Bill of Rights to me may be legal but I sure think it stinks Chet let me ask you know do you object to for example maybe Ford Motor Company or Chrysler or someone else doing a similar type commercial you objecting to that also	 if in if there's a lot more stairs often General Motors tag expressed was on there with General Motors it's not the question of the ad per se the ad because it's cigarettes and because it's a way for them to get their logo back on television under any circumstance however they did that I have real problems with that's clearly an attempt to circumvent the 71 band what I'm suggesting is not the end but the memorandum of understanding	 hey let me tell you this said is just the beginning of this campaign what it's done is it's given the Philip Morris Corporation essentially a license to use the Bill of Rights and to use the materials in the National Archives that other people don't have and that's what I find troubling I could come as I think the gentleman from Kansas asks a very legitimate question how far should we	 ego in allowing a restricting corporate sponsorship when it comes to ads of a public service nature and I would say that although I would find the other corporate sponsors personally I'd find them troubling because I do think there's a commercial exploitation involved here no I think I think the sponsorship by Philip Morris is nothing short of outrageous this is unique company this is a unique product this is a killer product and we know it and for us to add legitimacy to this product and this company with the you	 the National Archives is in my mind a step Way Beyond the very basic question the gentleman raises will the gentleman yield but just one second then I'll be happy to hear so dick to you do you suggest that that we should not allow other corporate entities in this country to have access to these sacred u.s. historical documents I concur quarterly basis of commercial exploitation and that's really what we're talking I concur completely with the gentleman my colleague from Massachusetts that this memorandum of understanding	 goes way too far to allow that sort of access to our National Treasures and that sort of access to truly unique recordings of the former presidents of the United States is in my estimation just gone entirely too far and it is true that we have corporate sponsorship for the restoration of the Statue of Liberty and other things most of those will have to be judged on a case-by-case basis but when you consider the power of this advertising Philip Morris isn't involved in this for totally altruistic motives they think it's going to help them from the	 this Viewpoint and if it's going to help them it's going to be at the expense of a lot of people and their health in this country but it be acceptable if and I don't want to belabor this too much longer but I'm just curious would it be acceptable for Philip Morris to emphasize craft General foods and Miller Brewing company instead of Philip Morris with that make it acceptable to you they didn't have the Philip Morris Crest there I think that there are there are two separate issues one is that I think that there's a	 a question of the unique and special relationship that this memorandum of understanding establishes between one Corporation a corporation that happens to produce an addictive drug as he's forty percent of its of its business and the National Archives which gives them a unique relationship if we have the National Archives had gone down and had put this thing up on The Auction Block	 I think all of us would have been offended irrespective of who came in at the high bidder I mean the concept of taking use of Our National Treasures in our images and imagery is so important in our lives and auctioning it off to the highest commercial bitter I think I certainly would find troubling no matter what company even if it was the American Cancer Society that came in and was the national the high bidder for the imagery of the Bill of	 it's and that's really what what was 444 lease here I think that the second question is a separate question is the question of this particular campaign this particular ad which allows a product which was banned from the airwaves and 71 allows them to get the logo back on onto the airwaves well I really appreciate the two of you coming today and	 as we deal with this problem I want you to know that I've been supportive I'm very sympathetic to trying to restrict the use of cigarettes wherever we can and tobacco products I have really struggled candidly with this first amendment question about what we can do with respect to commercial speech what kind of restrictions are legitimate I'm aware they've been recent Supreme Court decisions that have tended to Define this and and do so in perhaps a broader way than in the past I'm continuing to study that look forward to working with you during the five any additional time	 I guess almost time is expired the gentleman from Colorado was ask unanimous consent to be recognized I just just for one second and I think the gentleman made a very good point and I think the question was answered by the gentleman that that was the fact that if indeed it was craft or general foods that logo appeared on the end of the commercial the gentleman would object simply because of the memorandum or Ford Motor Company or anybody else if craft	 let's just take Ford Motor Company Ford Motor Company came in and used to access whatever access is allowed by present law to those materials that are available to every other Citizen and use that in an ad on the Bill of Rights and said Ford Motor Company I would not find that objectionable what I do find objectionable is the special and unique relationship that was entered into which gave Philip Morris	 access to use our national images and symbols in a way that no one else can I understand a gentleman but all I guess the only point I was trying to make the new would have ejected also to craft or general Foods only if they had the unique relationship not if they if they ran the same mad without the special access that the archives granted to Phillip are the Germany has a yield this has been characterized time to time as a contribution	 but as mr. Atkins has pointed out very effectively the memorandum of understanding takes this well beyond a contribution this is apparently binding contract I'm sure drawn up by the Philip Morris lawyers in which the considerations are set forth the six hundred thousand dollars on the one hand and then the right which obviously reading the four corners of the agreement is an exclusive right granted the Philip Morris to receive these least	 voices to go on the tube as a co-sponsor you notice the wording on didn't I hear that right then the National Archives come through as a co-sponsor of that ad of course hit that is the contract here which is more than just a sponsorship which we normally consider a sponsorship and this as you've indicated is only the beginning there's 30 million I understand that this is possibly two years and	 this may be a 60 million dollar deal and we've only seen the start of it as chairman if I might the memorandum of understanding makes clear that this is not
