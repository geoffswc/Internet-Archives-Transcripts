Tim Johnson and a good morning to you both Brennan let me start with you, you do you really want kids not to smoke or is this a PR campaign we really don't want kids to smoke in fact Charlie but his public service announcements that we provided a grant for are an extension of a long history of actions to keep kids from smoking the booklet that they promote tobacco helping you say no which helps parents work with their kids to reduce the peer pressure that's frequently the reason why kids smoke has been out for over a year in fact their print ads for them and in the last year, almost 200,000 parents have taken the time to call an 800 number or clip a coupon out of TV Guide a Parade Magazine to get the materials and the response has been so positive that working with the experts the family course Consortium of group of Educators and other people who work with children we decided to go on and take this to the next logical step which is television public service announcements and it's pretty exciting because it gives the opportunity for Millions more people to see and to in fact no of our offer for, for these free materials that do work that's what parents tell us Brennan there's a lot of money at stake more than three thousand teenagers a day I have read start smoking 3000 everyday start smoking and minors by billions of dollars of cigarettes you're ready to forego all that money absolutely if another child in the United States never picked up a cigarette that would be just fine with the tobacco companies it's that simple it's not only illegal for children to purchase cigarettes and in fact we've, in very active in the last year and helping passed laws to make it illegal for children to buy cigarettes and have been successful in five states and we have five states left to go for 1992 but beyond that there are things that we set aside for adults in the United States whether it's driving or drinking alcoholic beverages or voting or getting married smoking is one of those things you need to be an adult to have the information and to make a good decision about smoking so let's keep smoking for adults and if that, that means that the tobacco industry has to keep going with very Innovative programs very active programs to make sure our commitment is understood then that's what we'll do let me move to Tim Johnson Tim you have been highly skeptical of actions by the tobacco Institute in the past to say the least your reaction to this well the actual message I can't disagree with nor the effort of that message that is through parents trying to get kids to stop smoking but I must admit Charlie course I'm as you well know I'm a little slow at 7:30 in the morning I don't quite understand, why on the one hand they would send this message with their right hand and then with their left hand clearly be reaching out to young people with all of the seductive advertising I guess I would be really impressed with the commitment of the tobacco industry if they eliminated all of the seductive advertising showing young healthy people having a wonderful time while smoking and just stuck to informational advertising for adults well I was going to ask you what they would have to do to convince you that they were sincere and I gather that's what you'd say get rid of the advertising absolutely they will, always say of course that they're not appealing to kids with their advertising but they clearly show very young people whatever the ages in their twenties looking very appealing athletic healthy and that's what builds the peer pressure you know young people adolescents are always looking to model what they're slightly older kids are doing or what young people are doing so what would really impress me is to eliminate all of the seductive advertising use just hard informational advertising print advertising for the adults they are allegedly trying to reach, Brennan have to raise one other point to thoroughly real quickly she talks about this should be an adult Choice the AMA just recently did an extensive survey showing that the vast majority of people start smoking before adulthood and I guess I just ask you in all of our viewers to say how many adults do you know in your own circle of acquaintances who after college age sat down said you know this smoking makes a lot of sense I think I'm going to start that am a study I think said that 90 percent of adult smokers started in teens which makes the tobacco Institute to effort all the more interesting but too quickly Brennan let me ask you I seem to remember, that Henry Waxman who introduced the bill last year that would have prevented advertising spending everything in that young people would you support that there have been a number of bills introduced that would sensor the tobacco industry they range from complete bans on Advertising to things that would just make print ads available that look like stock offers no I wouldn't support that and in fact that's censorship it violates the First Amendment and a number of people agree with that on Capitol Hill as well as elsewhere but you know Tim's not going to be satisfied, satisfied until tobacco ads go away because he doesn't like them but the fact is that whether we look at the experience of other countries who have banned ads where teenage smoking rates can be twice what they are in the United States to the studies that look at why kids smoke and that's peer pressure and we in the family course Consortium are hitting that head-on all right Branden Dawson thanks very much Tim good to see you

Reynolds started to Market a new brand called uptown, cigarettes targeted to Black's the company canceled the project after Secretary of Health and Human Services Louis Sullivan sharply criticized the plan this weekend The Washington Post reported that Reynolds was developing a new brand called Dakota targeted two young white women with a high school education a newspaper printed what it claimed were internal memos from Reynolds marketing firm profiling what they called the Vero female a spokesman for RJ Reynolds told the news hour that the documents were, Gali obtained and that while some of the elements were adopted they were significantly altered to market the Dakota brand to both men and women at a senate hearing today secretary Sullivan returned to the attack and Charles Whitley of the titute defended the cigarette companies a cigarette is the only legal product that when used as intended causes death, advertisers who disproportionately Target women minorities Are Young Americans have gone too far, they must stop their irresponsibility, it is morally wrong to promote a product which when used as intended causes death, trading death for corporate profits, this is a difference which I will not let the industry spokespeople up for skate now let me address that just a minute we have always had retired just like every other industry advertisers particularly for a mature product the product that's been out there a long time not the brand new product that we try to inform people about for the first time and that is our individual companies which are highly competitive and they're out there fighting for market share they're out there fighting, going to induce people who smoke to smoke their brand to induce those who already smoked their brand to retain that brand loyalty and that's the purpose of the advertising is selling cigarettes different from selling other products we ask that question now of two people with different views John O'Toole is the president of the American Association of advertising agencies and Marie O'Keefe is a member of the executive committee of women versus smoking Network a washington-based, in of women's groups against smoking mr. O'Toole what do you think of secretary Sullivan's campaign well I think secretary Sullivant made confuse two issues one is tobacco cigarettes and the other is the marketing and advertising of tobacco and cigarettes it was evident in his statements that he was blaming advertising for some of the things that excessive smoking or continued smoking might do as far as targeting, like markets it only makes sense when you are involved in a product in a market that is shrinking and the the consumption of tobacco products is shrunk about six percent in the last year despite a lot of advertising to promote those products it only makes sense to try to divide that market up into segments that smoke a lot and segments that don't smoke or are ceasing to smoke and go after those who are heavy users heavy consumers so you see no moral difference between, between advertising is segmenting the cigarette audience consuming group and other products well I think there is a distinction to be made if it is a moral distinction perhaps it's between selling cigarettes and advertising cigarettes it is perfectly legal to sell cigarettes if therefore becomes somewhat hypocritical to condemn those who sell them through them through normal marketing techniques for doing so here it is, Keith how do you see the secretary's campaign well you know it's actually quite Insidious to Target such a vulnerable population for a product that kills so many of their users in fact some 25 to 30 percent of my sisters who will become addicted to this new product Dakota cigarettes will die from exactly that habit a lot of products in this country are, illegal and yet have severe restrictions on their advertising stocks and bonds for example can't be directly advertised and prescription drugs can't be directly advertised to Consumers and neither of those are killing almost 400,000 Americans each year well let's separate those two bits first of all it's Insidious mrs. O'Keefe says to Target vulnerable groups, I think mrs. O'Keefe is is making a statement that some of her sisters might not agree with that they are less capable of making their own judgments as to whether to buy a product or not then the society at large the the distinction here is between products that are perfectly legal to sell and available almost everywhere and stocks and bonds and prescription drugs no effort has been made to make cigarettes prescription, products therefore they can be purchased anywhere and normal marketing techniques can be used to sell them there are restrictions on age groups in some places that can buy them yes recognizing the fact that you're supposed to be 18 before you can purchase them mrs. O'Keefe what about the answer that your sisters is mrs. O'Toole puts it mr. O'Toole puts it are capable of making their own minds up you know it's ironic that RJ Reynolds had segmented and targeted exactly the population who are least, prepared to make up their minds 18 year old women are certainly old enough to want to assert their independence and their freedom which is what the Dakota marketing plan promises they can do if they smoke that cigarette but they aren't old enough to appreciate such abstract Concepts as chronic disease and death or addiction they think they'll be able to stop but it's literally the most, lethal and addictive drug we know this oh Keith continues to to confuse advertising with product and I do find it difficult to believe that 18 year old women are unable to make that judgment for themselves when the awareness of the dangers of smoking as a result of the surgeon general's warning on the product as well as the advertising that awareness is up in the 95% level I mean that's more people who can identify the vice president of the United States or their own, Senator well let's go to the regulation Point here do you do you as O'Keefe feel that what mr. Sullivan is doing secretary Sullivan by exhortation is a form of Regulation oh no it's much different from adjective from regulation secretary Sullivan much to his credit is engaging in a massive public education Campaign which is exactly why certain, serve our society mostly educated white males have stopped smoking in droves, I agree completely I think that what the secretary is doing is the right way to do it I think education more information rather than less information is the way to approach this problem well then if he's performing an education function and yet you would maintain that what RJ Reynolds has been doing is perfectly legitimate advertising practice for a legal product why does r.j. Reynolds cave in when the secretary criticizes them for instance on the Uptown product, I find it difficult to answer that question I think that RJ Reynolds should have responded with their own arguments and what let the public let the distributor's let the entire distribution chain make its own decisions what do you think mr. Keith well I have to say that unfortunately tobacco is hurting members of the undereducated and underemployed classes more than it is others it is, particularly harmful to women who suffer not only from all of the harmful tobacco induced diseases that men suffer from that is strokes and heart attacks lung cancer and chronic lung diseases but who also suffer the additional health effects that are related to the female hormone system for example osteoporosis and to the reproductive system for example infertility as a matter of, back in this country each year it's estimated that four thousand infants die simply because their mothers most those warnings exist on the on the cigarette packages but back to the business of Regulation hear you say that what mr. Sullivan is doing is education but if the RJ Reynolds company takes his criticisms and caves in on a on a on a marketing plan doesn't that amount to sort of Regulation by intimidation, RJ Reynolds got caught that got caught targeting a very vulnerable population their Public Image is extremely important to them and so they caved in the fact that we were able to get a hold of these marketing plans which was going after another very vulnerable population clearly defined as minors with no more than a high school education means hopefully that they'll cave in on this one certainly the women's community, Community the women versus smoking Network in particular is going to make exactly that demand that they stop Dakota in its tracks no matter who is caving in to whom the fact remains and empirical knowledge shows us that ceasing to Market are advertised these cigarettes is not going to diminish those markets that have decided they're going to smoke but general population is smoking less there are bound to be Pockets there were people are, aren't have not caught up yet the ability of an Advertiser to sell this product to those people who are smoking more is is guaranteed by the First Amendment for one thing and by Common Sense the problem that mrs. O'Keefe has is with the product not with the advertising it is the product that is resulting in health problems in this country not the advertising is okay well mr. Ochoa was confusing the First Amendment which does indeed protect our, visual rights to political Free Speech which does not by any stretch give equal protection to a corporation's right to commercially advertise a lethal and addictive product does the first the first amendment is interpreted by the Supreme Court in 1976 and 1980 again does guarantee the right of commercial speech except when it is false and misleading know the Supreme Court has given very limited recognition only as late as the night is the late 19th century, 70s to The Limited right to commercial free speech and the Supreme Court has specifically used the advertising of cigarettes as an example of what could be banned because there is a just cause for it see the tobacco industry knows that it has to replace 5000 smokers each day 1000 smokers who die from tobacco induced diseases and 4,000 others who died from either other diseases or who are able to quit, tobacco industry knows better than anyone that if you make it to adulthood your your chances and starting to smoke are very small therefore they're targeting children its children we're trying to protect it is not children in every survey that I have seen site parental influence or peer group influence as a reason for starting to smoke I am again I'm not here to defend tobacco I don't smoke, I don't like it and I'm happy the my family doesn't smoke the right however to Market and advertise a product that however hypocritical is still legally sold in this country is is an inalienable where's the hypocrisy mr. O'Toole well this is the argument seems to really be with the presence of cigarettes as long as cigarettes are there these these subgroups of the culture going to purchase them it, possible to ban such a product I doubt that it would work any more than it did in prohibition but it's possible I suppose it's also possible to stop subsidies to Tobacco Farmers the same legislators who talked about banning tobacco advertising or voting for substitutes immensities the tobacco it's being raised increasingly not only by mr. Keith but by others including the secretary as a moral argument now it is legal to buy market and Market cigarettes and it is legal as you, pointed out to advertise them at the moment do you sense though that this growing if it is growing moral argument will more and more and more push the tobacco companies into a corner where they will they just will not be able to do this and he said there were just feel they will feel frozen out for the same reason that RJ Reynolds backed off on the Uptown at no I don't think that is going to be the consequence I think what the consequence will be is another piece of information, send it to the public to make them think about cigarette smoking just as the label warnings the warnings and the advertising the many statements by the Surgeon General all of these has resulted in 95% of the population knowing that cigarette smoking is hazardous how do you how do you feel about that Mizuki 95 if 95% of the population know it's hazardous they include the people you're worried about yes but they haven't got any idea exactly how hazardous they certainly don't have a true appreciation for how addictive it is, the hypocrisy here is really an industry that makes 35 billion dollars a year selling this product spending 2.6 billion each year to hook new addicts to their product that's the hypocrisy to hook new adducts the attics the tobacco industry spokesman on the on the clip we showed earlier said the purpose was in to to make them to switch to another product what do you really do you really believe that mr. to I have to, leave it it's the marketing trimmer when you have a mature product and or category and it's shrinking every year it is economic Folly to try to bring more people into but the advertising promoting all sorts of healthy and happy occasions or sexy occasions or whatever is not intended to attract new young people to smoking it's intended to attract it as much much more economical to attract somebody who was smoking a cigarette with a different kind of image to this, this one that says look this one's for you for some reason this is reflects your way of life and yes they are attractive healthy people because it doesn't make much sense to use old sick people and that's it thank you mrs.

Sonia Friedman, Welcome to our Wednesday show in just a moment controversy over cigarette ads aimed at minorities but we'll continue our her telling you a little bit about the tobacco industry the tobacco industry spends over two billion dollars a year on advertisement and promotion anti-smoking groups are blaming the tobacco industry from bombarding Hispanic and black communities with twice as many cigarette ads and billboards as white communities on our battle lines today is the tobacco industry unfairly exploiting, communities with twice as much advertising than in other communities Pamela T Miller is a director of environmental and public health for New Jersey's Hudson County and former director of the minority Outreach for the American Lung Association and she says the tobacco industry is trying to reach groups with the least education and to raise their Market Walker merryman is Vice President of the tobacco Institute he says the tobacco companies are competing for brand loyalty than communities already, having heavy smokers welcome to both of you and I guess the first question in all fairness should go to you Pamela Miller and it is do you truly believe that the tobacco industry is deliberately targeting minority communities of course the tobacco industry is targeting minority communities the tobacco industry is in a position of having to profit from a very segmented population and is therefore Tau, getting a population that is reaping it tremendous profits by that we mean predominantly Black and Hispanic markets the tobacco industry is launching a very calculated effort to entice ever younger smokers of course they're killing lost their best customers every younger smokers who are very impressionable who are asked to take on the deadly habit of cigarette smoking mr. Merriman that is quite an accusation, ization that Miss Miller makes would you like to respond well I'm a little amazed at what appears to be her lack of familiarity with a lot of the data regarding people who smoke for example amongst two youngsters in this country virtually every major study that's been done since the early and mid 1970s shows that the percentage of youngsters smokings going down now I can assure you that the people who Market tobacco products in this country number one have, directed marketing or advertising at youngsters for many many many years and as a matter of fact have taken active steps to avoid doing that and to discourage youngsters from smoking and secondly I can assure you they are not stupid that is in fact if they were spending two billion dollars on something that didn't work they wouldn't do it you advertise and you do promotional efforts for any consumer product where the market happens to be you can't create a market for a product that's been around for as long, his cigarettes just as you can't create a market for automobiles or a market for anything else that is a product that's been in Commerce for a long time it's impossible to do that so what you do is you advertise to people who use the product hoping to reach those who use it and get them to switch their brands or to maintain their loyalty to the brand in this case of cigarettes that they already smoked all right yes Miss Miller I think we have to be very honest with our viewers there is, the theory of expanding markets the tobacco industry is placed in the position of having to expand its market and in targeting markets we look at the trend now of coming up with cigarette brands like Doral that we've never seen before that type of cigarette is marketed specifically to a Hispanic population Mexican American males the tobacco industry is taking a look at minority youngsters minority communities and tailor-made, making products and Taylor making its promotions to best fit what the aspirations of those communities are look at as a for instance the repeated support of organizations like the United Negro College Fund by the tobacco industry over decades so that youngsters who are in the universities and colleges will identify presumably their Good Fortune of a fine education with the, ship ever of this industry mr. Merriman's unhappy with the analogy you just made over there let's hit get his comments on that mr. Merriman well I think that in this case it's unfortunate sad even that the contribution that the industry has made to the minority Community for 40 years and more isn't being recognized the United Negro College Fund the Urban League the n-double-a-cp a lot of minority groups and communities all over the country, country have been supported through sponsorship and through grants when it was most unpopular in some parts of the country to do so this isn't something we started doing yesterday or last month or last year we've always recognized that we have as an industry a responsibility to the community now obviously as with any consumer product you're going to try to Target your advertising and promotion apart from your philanthropic efforts toward that part of the community where your product is, heavily used that does not mean I am precise again targeting advertising or promotion toward youngsters that's never been part of our of our effort we voluntarily in 1963 removed all celebrities and sports heroes from advertising we took all promotional activities off college campuses in 1969 we volunteer to go off radio and television advertising about four years ago we entered into a program with the National Association of state boards of Education, Tatian to actively discourage youngsters from taking up smoking because we do firmly feel that it is an adult custom so I think our record in terms of voluntary action is most responsible and I think commendable I can't think of another industry as soon as much mr. let me ask you something is the tobacco industry really doing anything different from what a number of Industries do the alcohol industry and there are many other certainly including beauty products, glamorizing offering a promise or hope even if it's illusionary is it any different the one difference with this industry in relationship to what it does of relationship to other Industries is of course the product itself cigarettes are product that by being used for the way in which they were intended is dangerous causes ill health causes death if cigarettes are, are used for the one purpose they are intended and there is no other purpose other than smoking them eventually one will become ill and and deaf is associated inextricably with the you the proper use of this product that's the difference and we see the results of promotions and advertising of this product in illness and death disproportionately in minority communities we see black males suffering from lung cancer, two and a half times that in terms of their race as it relates to their fight counterparts even when you adjust for socio-economic status so the Betrayal by the tobacco industry of the way that it promotes its deadly product to minority communities is is off course what we're seeing is minority youngsters again youngsters no one gets to be 40 or 45 year old years old, old and take up the smoking habit people begin smoking when they are 10 11 and 12 years old all right let me stop you and if I may please because I'd like to give mr. Merriman an opportunity to respond before we go to our view or calls let's talk about ethics and advertising whose responsibility is it to continue to warn people about what the studies have demonstrated we know that next week is the 25th anniversary of the surgeon general's warning concerning cigarettes does the advertising company it, so if any of the cigarette companies have some ethical responsibilities there mr. Merriman well obviously every advertisement that the tobacco industry runs in this country whether it's billboard or magazine or newspaper has to carry one of four different warnings from the Surgeon General of the United States they are prominently placed they carry a very significant and severe approachment to people who pick up that pack or look, at that advertisement I don't think there could be possibly a single sentient human being in this country even one who is functionally illiterate who isn't aware of what the Surgeon General and many others I think have said about the smoking and health controversy I don't think that's really the issue the issue is should the tobacco industry which produces a legal product have the right to engage in commercial, freedom of speech let me stop you right there you have two adults who want it you have just given us and obviously the Supreme Court of the United States has said yes you have a right to advertise a legal problem and as long as that advertising is truthful I'm going to ask you to stop at this moment if you will please because you have phrased the question to the audience and they can respond I mean what is the real issue here and does be tobacco industry have the right to sell this, this product which is a legal product to communities whomever they may be let's hear your response of 2 1 3 4 6 9 5 5 3 3, we're asking whether the tobacco industry has been barding minority markets with glamorized adds more so than other markets and we're talking with attorney Pamela Miller director of environmental and public health and Hudson County New Jersey and walk a Merriman vice-president of the tobacco Institute let's hear from one of our viewers Geo from Ohio with us now hello Joe how are you, yeah I have a question for the director of environment and health and I wanted to know if she feels that sort of some type of prohibition like we had earlier in this Century regarding alcohol if the tobacco industry should really be denied the same marketing strategies that any company producing a potentially harmful product like sausage or something high in cholesterol is allowed to practice and their marketing strategies okay let that Pamela that question, I think we have to look at the cigarette for what it really is cigarettes of the major component of cigarettes and nicotine nicotine is a drug in this country we have regulatory bodies that look at the way that controlled dangerous substance has narcotics and drugs are distributed and are made available to the American public nicotine through cigarettes should in my mind in my estimation should not be an exception it, the drug it evokes an enormous amount of physical responses even in the first puff it has very long ranging to build a Tory effects over time so what is your answers is your answer yes that there should be a Prohibition my answer is that Federal regulatory bodies should treat nicotine and cigarettes as they do other control dangerous substances okay let's go on to Joanna and California Joanna hello yes, basically what I wanted to say to mr. Merriman is that I find myself truly insulted that he would assume that a consumer would not have enough sense to know that when they sell a product that they have to Target someone whether that for that that consumer is white or black Hispanic rich or poor now I have been a nonsmoker now for about five years and even as a child I remember looking at ads that showed that cools were directed to blacks, Miss Merriman well obviously the people who make any consumer product know what their Market is and when you have a product like cigarettes with about 270 some different brands the market for each of those Brands is going to be pretty small fairly narrow in generally speaking so you have to be able to know who smokes that product if it's blacks or Hispanics then obviously most of your marketing, and advertising and promotion are going to be in the black Hispanic minority community that just makes sense because you can't take a product that people don't use and make them use it there simply isn't any academic research data anywhere in the world which shows that advertising makes smokers out of non-smokers it's simply that way let me stop you so that we can get to Howard from New Jersey please Howard yes I think it's um it's very, naive to assume that these people don't really Target these audiences in a very Insidious and purposeful way and I know in the case of the jazz festivals which Philip more you'll see all their representatives they are out in the audience out the reception area lobbying like a bunch of politicians, okay do you know the idea is is there something wrong with you admitting that your target is there mr. Merriman well I think I've said that half a dozen times that you go where the market is the markets established those people even then let me ask you and you're going to Target your advertising and promotion at that group of people who use that brand Miss Miller you know in our last moment let me just ask you this question we've now looked at the responsibility of the tobacco industry and where ever you may stand on that, about the consumer and the responsibilities of the consumer I think the responsibility of the consumer should be likened to the responsibilities of the consumer when we're looking at any product or drug or food that's manufactured for a profit in this country manufacturers liability has held clear for many many decades in this country when an organization group of people stockholders owners of companies decide for, a prophet to manufacture a food distribute a drug a make available a product for profit and they have to take all the attended liability that comes with that consumers should be given the best available information by that manufacturer now there are consumer groups Advocate groups like the American Lung Association for example that are out there really attempting to educate the American and and the, population about an unhealthy effects of smoking but it smell any fractures liability has to hold clear here I thank you so much both of you for being with us today I think there's lots more to be said about the subject and to where actually the final responsibility must lie thank you again thank you and we continued the top headlines this Wednesday",0.8498712902941176,0.75060654,0.9128392

Reynolds and Philip Morris companies because they're advertising never mentions the health risks but in many countries there are no laws requiring Health warnings and Connolly says in countries that do require it the tobacco companies hire politically influential people like Michael Deaver to apply pressure the companies have, cleverly used tobacco politics in the US to get their product in but they've done so at the expense of many other American goods and services we tried to get some cigarette companies to respond to the charges but they declined a spokesperson from RJ Reynolds did say he would only talk to me over the phone Ron field said his company made 28 million dollars in Asia last year any added where the we have warnings on something or not it doesn't mean we are fooling the public the tragedy will be is, use a nation will promote unnecessary death and disease overseas because of the actions of our company's Rosanna Scotto Fox News Channel 5, from the world's Financial Capital New York City this is business morning with Stuart Varney for Thursday June 16th 1988, only facts are presentable in a court of law but cash could be the most important factor in determining who actually wins a courtroom battle Richard Roth takes a look at the recent lawsuit involving three major tobacco company's lawyers for Antonio chip alone spent over two million dollars to sue three tobacco companies the jury awarded chip alone four hundred thousand dollars in Damages it's the first time a cigarette company has been held liable for damages financially the plaintiff was a loser but the trip alone sides, the defendant lost more quite frankly they spend fifty million dollars in came up paying us 400,000 so in terms of Investments I think they came out on the short end of the stick but the cigarette companies refused to confirm they spend 50 million dollars I'll tell you how much this case fast it cost too much tobacco companies have used their huge financial War chest to wear down many liability suits in the past that philosophy is shown in a leaked memo written by an attorney for RJ Reynolds after a court Victory the memo was sent to the National Law Journal, I talked about paraphrasing General Patton we make the son of a bitch spend more of his money that we spend of ours but the organizer of liability suits against the tobacco industry thinks the damage award will encourage more suits with will eventually hurt the company's financially if the first case one of these many cases is worth four hundred thousand dollars you really have to multiply that by in considering the industries exposure by the number of cases they can be faced with tobacco industry analysts think otherwise I think future cases are there, it you will be increasingly discouraged as the lawyers lose interest in getting a home run and getting the Mega Bucks out of it Antonio chip alone and his legal team have not decided how the four hundred thousand dollars gets divided both the industry and the anti-tobacco forces remain divided over what the 400,000 means four thousand dollars is just is kind of irrelevant really in the argument is just a number that they finally won something but it's symbolic yes symbolic exactly and the cigarette companies and the people that want to sue them vow to spend as much, much as necessary to win their fight Richard Roth CNN New York",0.8427452125,0.7164655,0.90655637

ask for and more I was looking for a company that I belong to I wasn't trying to get a job I was trying to find a place I can truly say that we have more resources at our grasp than any organization that I've ever worked with and all of the organizations that I have worked with have been Fortune,companies I remember when a Philip Morris recruiter came to NYU and one of the things that the woman talked a lot about was how challenging and fun her job was and I thought to myself and that's exactly the kind of job I'm looking for and I can honestly say that I found that here I have came from Procter & Gamble I came from Leo Burnett after that so when I was looking to make a job change to come to Philip Morris I looked at a bunch of different brand management company, he's and I think the interesting thing about Philip Morris is not only does it not have a lot of the negatives you might find it also has a lot of positives that you would never have dreamed of, you come tomorrow it's the biggest brand in the world everything we do tries to convey that this is the biggest brand that we do things that nobody else can do so it's exciting everyone has some contact with this brand and I think that's kind of the most exciting thing about it is that you do something that's really out there in the marketplace you're not pushing papers and if the whole purpose of marketing is to create a brand image well I don't think anybody does it better than we do we've done programs like the Marlboro Adventure team you know multi multi multi-million dollar, Graham that had all sorts of different variations all sorts of consumer applications it was the biggest promotion that any consumer Products company has ever executed the promotion sort of range is the Spectrum from actually a continuity offer that a catalog promotion actually that allows consumers to save their proofs of purchase to get free stuff now in terms of consumers participating over 5 million consumers have participated in the adventure to promotion I think to date we've shipped over 30 million items to consumers in effect what we did with, our team was we entered a new business and that is probably the most exciting part about filthy Adventure team promotion in the Country Store promotion and so while I work in brand management these programs have allowed me to actually be a general manager and get into establishing setting up and running a new business so in that way it's an unbelievable challenge for me and it's been wonderful I'd fortunate in inheriting the Virginia Slims ad Campaign which was developed in the late 60s as brand manager I am responsible for, the equity of Virginia Slims and I try to keep that Equity constant while maintaining the freshness of the advertising and it's all image image image image we have to be the Setters of the trend we don't do exactly what the consumer tell us but more what we think they are going to want they wear is is a fashion catalogue that we launched every season top Mars has a commitment to other many other programs we actually have consumers that, ask us one is the book of days coming this year the book of days is an appointment book that contains coupons both Virginia Slims coupons and coupons with other tie-in partners might have to watch for bowling balls because Merit bowling is on my floor and they practice Virginia Slims tennis tennis rackets tennis people you never know who's going to show off Billie Jean King Chris Evert Martina Navratilova these people walk around this building and, it still amazes me that I work here, the culture at Philip Morris is a lot of fun very relaxed yet intense if that makes sense when I wake up everyday I'm really only limited by my imagination what I can actually dream up I've gotten new responsibilities as soon if not sooner than I'm ready for it which has kept me on my toes which is kept me really loving what I do because I'm never never bored nobody has brands of size that we do nobody has certainly the long, image in the marketplace that we do I think this is one of the most creative places I've ever been and I also think there's a real attitude on the part of management you know to let people be creative and to let people do the most that they can do so while you would have found any one of those things at a variety of other places here kind of all comes together in one package and I really have found it unusual our management here always wants the big the biggest the best idea the undone and lots of times, the company is willing to spend against it that's a situation and those are dynamics that you really don't find very frequently there's always room for individuality there's always room for having fun I mean we joke around a lot a lot during the day we're all aggressive excited about what we're doing I think there's a lot of fun I think people work hard and play hard and that's probably you know the attitude that's most prevalent, the mission that Philip Morris USA is relatively simple it's to be the most successful consumer packaged goods company in the world simple in terms of words more difficult in execution because the key to the execution is people it's to hire the right people and then to train and develop those people in such a way as they can contribute to their utmost and that involves treating the individual as an individual giving them the respect that they deserve, deserve and want and can flourish with and the recognizing their diversity if you bring all of those things together in your people you can be truly the most successful consumer packaged goods company in the world",0.8389665114285715,0.7336841,0.91283935

Waterman assistant to the president of the tobacco Institute is here we'll talk to him about that so stay with us we'll be back in just a minute, about a month ago we told you about a movement underway to keep check on the movie industry which According to some was subliminally encouraging smoking by the use of smoking and product names within the film's critics claim the tobacco industry is not only aware that this occurs but promotes it and to counter these claims we've invited walk of merry men from the tobacco Institute who was vice president and director of communications, mr. chairman thank you for joining us thank you I am what is the tobacco industry's response to critics claims that you not only know about this happening in films but you promote it for perhaps even financially well I think it's terribly unfortunate that what we're seeing apparently is a group of people with a lot of free-floating hostility unbridled rescue fantasies who cannot believe that those 60 million American adults who have decided that they wish to make smoking part of their lifestyle have in fact made what, what they believe to be the correct decision there is a bit of coercion in that sort of Outlook that I don't think is proper you and I as adults can make those decisions for ourselves about whether or not we wish to smoke or drink alcoholic beverages or engage in a number of other activities which are perfectly legal and part of some people's Lifestyles not for others but those are things which you and I can decide for ourselves whether or not an individual manufacturer of a product seeks to, out of that product promoted is entirely up to them as long as it's legal let's talk specifically about the film's because what critics are citing is the use of lots of billboards perhaps in films when a actors driving down a road we see a billboard for with a product name on it or perhaps many people within the film smoking with the packages of cigarettes laying before them with the name clearly printed on there are individual companies to your knowledge supporting films or the producers, he's in the making of the film's by saying I will give you such and such amount of money if you will indeed use Marlboro Kent whatever in the film if the film is going to accurately represent what is in a particular City and a particular area of the country they're going to obviously see some people who smoke they may even see some cigarette Billboards they may see Billboards and other parts of Lifestyles which represent many other things if the manufacturer of a product to sides that you wants to approach a, producer and say listen if you're going to do this why don't you use my product because we've got a good product with a good image lots of people smoke it lots of people use it I don't see anything wrong with that is simply another man another manner of promoting and advertising if you will another type of legal product we don't have the opposition here to State this but I almost think that they might agree with you in what you said earlier about adults making their own decisions on their own but when they took a look at the, the film's where many cigarettes were advertised or subliminally advertised it was in the films that appeal to youth particularly films like Superman do you think the tobacco industry is really aiming their advertisements towards uses that as the market hit and perhaps they don't make up their minds as well as adults do well obviously anyone who's followed the research Trends over the years knows that the trend among young people and smoking is consistently down since at least 1977 all of the, is show that that trend is going down advertising and promotion of cigarettes is never made a smoker out of a nonsmoker it reinforces brand loyalty or switches brand loyalty but all of the academic research shows that it appeals to adults who've already made that decision and it doesn't have anything to do with making smokers out of non-smokers making kids smokers our policy as an industry since the early 60s 1963 has been in our advertising, why not to use celebrities not to use Sports Heroes not to use people who are under the age of 25 not to advertise on college and university campuses even or promote the product they're in we want to promote the product generally in an adult environment that's where it's going to stay since you say that the advertising has been limited and it has bylaws in itself and not only due to the limited advertising but also the surgeon general's statements on the dangers involved in smoking how is that affected the tobacco, three has it well there has been an increase in the population over the years so you have to factor that in when you really honestly trying to decide whether there's been a real increase there has been real growth in the industry about 640 billion cigarettes were sold last year that was another record I think this year it probably is frankly going to be down a little bit because the federal tax was doubled on the first of January and Nine States including mosura increase their taxes last year that's probably going to have some kind of negative, effect on the industry but generally speaking the people who make cigarettes in the companies they work for are very well thought of by Financial analysts there's there has been for many many years now been a lot of information published and that has come up regarding health effects on health we're kind of research does it Tobacco Institute or the tobacco industry do regarding health Susan says 1954 the cigarette, where's the tobacco industry has sponsored independent scientific research at hospitals and universities all over the country at Washington University here in St Louis there is a very very large program being sponsored by the tobacco industry completely hands-off no strings attached the people who do that research or free to publish whatever their results show with no clearance from the industry in advance this program totally now approaches about 111 million dollars it's, greater than the combined research efforts of the American Cancer Society the American Lung Association and the American Heart Association on smoking and health research were very proud of it because it is arm's length research its basic research no strings attached we want to continue it no breakthroughs are evident but obviously there is continued interest in the smoking and health controversy from a scientific standpoint because people keep applying for these research grants welcome Aaron and I'm afraid we're out of time, thank you for coming back with us and in response to what we heard on claims about similar levels advertising thank you once again Walker Clips

""THE LIBERTAD FORUM ON COMMERCIAL FREE SPEECH""",1993,"The LibertAd Forum participants discuss issues related to free speech, First amendment, and advertising.","tobacco, cigarette,advertising, marketing, legal right, lawyer, business activity",tobacco_cub77c00,"freedom of commercial speech is as vital to our Democratic process is freedom of religious political and artistic speech,remember to handful of people to say but some forms of free speech are not as free as others is to abdicate freedom of choice and undermine the foundations of free societies everywhere in the fall of each year at the Harriman New York country Campus of Columbia University and international group of distinguished jurist lawyers legislators journalist authors Executives and representatives of,Communications and entertainment Industries need to discuss issues concerning free speech and democracy issues that touch the lives of free people everywhere, in my view there aren't a lot of people who really believe in the First Amendment most people tend to believe or to want to allow the sort of speech they find congenial and that is true in all areas of speech whether it is political speech or commercial speech all the more necessary in my view is it to have as categorical protections for speech as possible as few distinctions as possible, it's impossible to say that the constitution itself draws any distinction between economic rights and the other personal rights I think the close relationship between pre markets and free speech and political Freedom ultimate human Liberty is is undeniable the First Amendment includes the right of free association it's not all that easy to distinguish between so-called political and economic associations because, most of our political associations are organized for economic purposes of course if we view speech and conversation in the continuing debate as an end in itself I think we might reach a different conclusion on Commercial speech as well as other areas of speech in immediate Court said as we lead the Oregon cases it's really the Oregon Constitution we are not going to distinguish something called commercial speech from something that is any other kind of speech to text of the First Amendment doesn't mention political speech, nor commercial speech and I think the surest most consistent and certainly most principled Safeguard is to do what I gather as just as Linda you refers to an organ you know make a distinction where the statute or the Constitutional provision doesn't have it, now one doesn't have to be a hyper littlest to see the danger of letting the government the very government of the first amendment is designed to rein in Define which speech has high value and which speech has lower value in fact in political speech we can be told lies and it's a lot tougher to protect ourselves is the conclusion we got to have him start regulating the political speech at this point I don't know what is politics other than the pursuit of power and if you've got the power, you've got the politics and if you've got the power you'll Define Freedom as you choose to free to Define freedom I think if there's any argument at all for advertising being regulated political advertising gets it the most because if you buy a different brand of chicken and I do I could care less but if you vote for someone based on a promise that will never be realized and it's not properly discounted it's going to affect me it scares the hell out of me too, the most painful denial of freedom of the most painful thing was that you were denied the basic right to pass judgment on anything you were denied the right to say what do you think about world since we human beings differ from animals exactly by our capacity to formulate judgments, the separation of this freedom in fact that used us the status of Edibles as we consider this situation where what did they fight for not only freedom of Oppression but also Freedom from Want, and as they try to reconstruct their countries they realize that there is such a necessity and economic Port consideration of how to build up a mode of living whereby everybody has a good life we are focusing in Poland very much on political Freedom entertainment out enough and had in attention to things like like commercial free speech, the first things must come first we are developing this free market institutions and this is the part and parcel of it the subject of our International for room inspires me as person but also as in Hungarian citizen who knows very well what is exactly the meaning of freedom and what it means not to have it it is a fact that the only way news media can survive, free and independently is file support of advertising, one magazine that has no advertising its Congressional quarterly and I'd like to add and it's a very good magazine and I'd like to point out that it's subscription rate is now about 500 dollars per year it gives you an idea of what what the cost is for a magazine with no advertising that's high quality in Germany weekly jounin John wants 20 to 30 percent of its money from subscribe, between 70 and 80% from advertisement so you would destroy a lot of jobs you will not destroy a lot of journals and newspapers without that the fact that there isn't any media covering this I think is really surprises me because it's in their interest to pay attention to the threats there are two commercial free speech and Free Speech in general if you suddenly band advertising in a country where advertising is customary, a lot of newspapers would collapse and the rest would be a few newspapers which would have a more or less Monopoly situation and that would certainly not be conducive to freedom of discussion this is the key which one somebody sometimes tends to forget the most important reason for Relevant freedom of commercial speech is it only that gives you, a benefit when you develop new products as no point in developing new and improved products unless you can communicate in the consumer if your product is bad no amount of advertising will keep you there you can buy your way in but you won't stay there Communications to me is the key weapon of competition you can look at various Industries to see how they become lethargic without that communication weapon without Communications companies are handcuffed in terms of competition without competition you don't have economic growth, people in the United States people in Europe would never ever think of advertising as a human rights issue but if in fact you spent much time in Africa or in or in some parts of Latin America you will know that because the government bans advertising that that effectively shuts out any non-government press there are many journalists all over the world and especially in Africa who regularly go to jail, for saying what they say it's only through Western multinational advertising that in fact popular alternative presses and Free Press can exist outside of the government control press That's particularly true in the third world you can't legislate the good sense or common sense first of all or even good behavior and you can't legislate for the lowest common denominator in Market there's always somebody who wants to be the complete idiot with all due respect, Beckett and that's not how we can steer society when you start restricting the ability of people to use their property to have their property to sell their property you also start restricting their ability to have their lives to exist to make a living to to live in society and to draw these artificial lines I think leads you down the slippery slope these days today are particularly Dangerous Ones in terms of, protecting commercial speech and if I could will one thing it would be an explosion of writing and commentary and Analysis in this area which would alert people including judges to the severity of the risks that lie before us, we all know it's wrong any any ban on commercial free speech is wrong there question is what can we do about it it's got to come up in education it's got to come up in the media articles about it so that people understand that it really is a fundamental issue it's much more than just Banning ads Constitution is very clear on this it says that the government shall make no law abridging freedom of speech doesn't say abridging freedom of speech and adds it doesn't say, except if you say check on college campus there is no caveat in the Constitution it is could not be simpler the First Amendment only really becomes important when you disagree with whatever someone is saying that's what it's really about it doesn't you don't need an amendment with everybody agrees with you when you're speaking out for a minority opinion is when it counts and I think it it is crucial I think it is significant that an international organization like Liberty, Todd has been formed designed to spread First Amendment rights to countries that do not have them enshrined in our constitution as we are fortunate to do",0.8488378823999999,0.6758793,0.9128386
