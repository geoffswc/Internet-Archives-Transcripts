isn't that a lot of money from one group to pay for programs that should be everyone's responsibility before you vote read amendment one then ask yourself “is it really fair”.


we we the people of colorado. . . our state constitution for 157 years it's kept our democratic ideals and principles and protected our individual rights so why would we put tobacco taxes and health care spending programs into it the tobacco amendment is a constitutional amendment it makes health care spending programs and three new tobacco taxes permanent parts of colorado's constitution. vote no on the tobacco tax amendment because even if you’re for the spending programs in new taxes they don't belong in our constitution.


ballot initiatives can be confusing so before you vote read proposition 200 carefully then ask yourself “is a 90 million dollar tax increase on smokers really fair where will the money go and why would we give millions to bureaucrats without any controls on how it's spent” prop 200 has a lot of problems but don't take my word for it. copies of prop 200 are available in the secretary of state's office so you can read it and make the right choice. paid for by the no more taxes committee majority of funding provided by the tobacco industry and the tobacco institute. paid for by the no more taxes committee majority of funding provided by the tobacco industry and the tobacco institute.


cozeny californians they raise millions by taxing smokers but look how they spent the money. five hundred thousand dollars to sponsor a race car they wasted even more money sponsoring floats and parades they even paid for a fiveday pool party cool. now they want to do the same thing in arizona vote no on prop 200. wasting tax money is one california idea we don't need. bummer.


 arizona's cancer heart and lung association's and 200 000 arizona citizens worked hard to place proposition 200 the tobacco tax on the ballot now the tobacco companies are paying us a visit and they're dressing up for the occasion. they're coming to protect their profits by trying to defeat the tobacco tax and they're going to mislead the public under the cloak of deception. don't let the tobacco companies pull the wool over your eyes. paid for by arizona for a healthy future healthcare providers and the arizona hospital association.


it's a shame isn't it. most of them started smoking so young and they weren't told that the nicotine in cigarettes could keep them hooked forever. but now we know how to keep tobacco out of the hands of kids. we can prevent vending machine sales and crack down on merchants who sell to minors we can also raise the cost of cigarettes through change in public policy and increase education about the effects of smoking and when fewer children are smoking we’ll all breathe a little easier. oh your mom will love those flowers. how is my mom she's doing okay.


you're sick and tired of the cigarette prison. who’s to tell us us to sell cigarettes it’s outrageous.  they say they are not advertising cigarettes to children but kids recognize joe camel nearly as much as mickey mouse they could’ve given us a better name. i'd like to give those tobacco companies a piece of my mind. i’d tell him what a battery they are on the kids in arizona. no camels don’t smoke and kids shouldn’t either.",-0.800000011920929,2.400000095367432,-0.3000000119209289,17.399999618530273,0.882170542635659,0.0004494968102981707

with milestones and blended to the first successful filter cigarette from advances in menthol flavour to unique filter configurations technological leadership which has taken us to the limits of low tar innovation until today the challenge to create the severity of the 90s the vision to provide our consumers with a cleaner way to smoke the goal to continue a long tradition of technological leadership pioneering new horizons in cigarettes design responding to an ever changing consumer environment the commitment five years and hundreds of millions of dollars in research and development unprecedented marketing advertising and sales support dead educated members of the rj our family all working together to make the vision a reality the promised to build a bold new future for rj reynolds tobacco the result the most powerful new sales opportunity of its kind ladies and gentlemen you stand at the threshold of a new era in smoking and johnson you are about to introduce one of the most dramatic advances in the history of the tobacco industry through the years reynolds has pioneered innovations in cigarette technology from advances in blending with camel to filter technology with winstonsalem to breakthroughs in low tar with vantage and now premier represents in my opinion our greatest technological achievement to date premier is the result of years of work at our research and development center in winstonsalem the product is a direct response to the increasing pressures facing today's smokers pressures ranging from the claims and perceptions about smoking to social pressures from friends family and coworkers premier is also the first of what we believe will be a whole new generation of cigarettes just as filtered cigarettes revolutionize the industry in the 50s premier will open a new range of options to today's smokers certainly the foremost issue facing the brand is its successful introduction into test market firmly establishing premier is a major new brand is critical to the effectiveness of later expansions and we've selected the phoenix tucson and st. louis markets to launch premiere for two reasons first we expect the brand to have its greatest appeal in major metropolitan areas where target competitive smokers are concentrated and also we're smoking issues are more prevalent we also have the utmost confidence that our sales force in these key cities will effectively implement the most aggressive sales and marketing program ever undertaken by our company i'm extremely proud of our people and our company for having the creativity commitment and dedication necessary to develop this tremendous innovation in cigarette design equally gratified in the knowledge that this pioneering new brand now leaves our hands in winstonsalem and is being passed on to you the finest and most respected selling force in our country i believe premier will change the industry as we know it quite simply it's our biggest opportunity since winston we are confident the premier's introduction will be successful and we are tremendously excited about its future many weeks of 70 our they we really almost had to make people leave whenever we take people touring our facilities you just feel the commitment you feel the dedication truly a magnificent team effort and truly a tribute both to our people and to our couple i've been involved with the project from its inception as a matter of fact i feel like this is my baby we have had as he would expect in most research situations tremendous enthusiasm about this part they're from a research directors point of view it's even more than that it's watching people meet a great challenge what's interesting about people is that if you give them a challenge they respond magnificently and from my point that's watching that response this just so wonderful and when you see that across the laboratory and then when i got out of the laboratory into other areas within the company and watch the same response you know you've got something very great you're dealing with premier represents a tremendous breakthrough in cigarette technology that will give us a decided edge in the marketplace premier is a real leg up on the competition philip morris can't match it neither can brown & williamson are any other tobacco company with unique and important benefits to offer today's smoker premiere should capture a significant share of market i'm excited about career as the first of a new generation of advanced technology products that will position our jr for the future with the ever building pressure of our industry premier is a timely and positive step in advancing our role as leaders in innovation in the cigarette business okay i'll tell you the thing that i remember the most is after working with a very small staff of people for the first couple of years one person growing two three and then about five and going through a lot of different ideas that didn't pan out somebody ran into my office one day and they said my god come to the lab come to the lab now we've got to show you something and i went and what they showed me was the concept of became premier and that's to me that was the best day coming from tobacco field which was quite an honor to work on the world's largest modern cigarette factory to come to this project which now is the transition like going from chewing tobacco to a cigarette is that major transition and see this exciting challenge both for the manufacturing process and for the marketing and sales force it really gives the marketing and sales people another alternative offered to all the smokers he should sell it and mark it and should fast and that's really what this past year has been about what we have worked very very hard and developing what we feel is the very best promotional plan ever executed by reynolds tobacco whether the programs are delivered at retail or through direct mail they're all specifically designed to make sure that each smoker has a quality trial experience with premier and to make sure that they understand about the product and know the benefits that premier brings to

millions of dollars in research and development unprecedented marketing advertising and sales support dedicated members of the rjr family all working together to make the vision a reality. the promised to build a bold new future for rj reynolds tobacco the result the most powerful new sales opportunity of its kind. ladies and gentlemen you stand at the threshold of a new era in smoking and johnson you are about to introduce one of the most dramatic advances in the history of the tobacco industry a cleaner smoke premier. through the years reynolds has pioneered innovations in cigarette technology from advances in blending with camel to filter technology with winstonsalem to breakthroughs in low tar with vantage and now. premier represents in my opinion our greatest technological achievement to date premier is the result of years of work at our research and development center in winstonsalem . the product is a direct response to the increasing pressures facing today's smokers. pressures ranging from the claims and perceptions about smoking to social pressures from friends family and coworkers premier is also the first of what we believe will be a whole new generation of cigarettes just as filtered cigarettes revolutionize the industry in the 50s premier will open a new range of options to today's smokers certainly the foremost issue facing the brand is its successful introduction into test market firmly establishing premier is a major new brand is critical to the effectiveness of later expansions and we've selected the phoenix tucson and st. louis markets to launch premiere for two reasons first we expect the brand to have its greatest appeal in major metropolitan areas where target competitive smokers are concentrated and also we're smoking issues are more prevalent. we also have the utmost confidence that our sales force in these key cities will effectively implement the most aggressive sales and marketing program ever undertaken by our company i'm extremely proud of our people and our company for having the creativity commitment and dedication necessary to develop this tremendous innovation in cigarette design i'm equally gratified in the knowledge that this pioneering new brand now leaves our hands in winstonsalem and is being passed on to you the finest and most respected selling force in our country i believe premier will change the industry as we know it quite simply it's our biggest opportunity since winston. we are confident the premier's introduction will be successful and we are tremendously excited about its future. many weeks of 70 hour work they we really almost had to make people leave whenever we take people touring our facilities you just feel the commitment you feel the dedication truly a magnificent team effort and truly a tribute both to our people and to our company. i've been involved with the project from its inception as a matter of fact i feel like this is my baby we have had as you would expect in most research situations tremendous enthusiasm about this part they're from a research directors point of view it's even more than that it's watching people meet a great challenge what's interesting about people is that if you give them a challenge they respond magnificently and from my point that's watching that response this just so wonderful and when you see that across the laboratory and then when i got out of the laboratory into other areas within the company and watch the same response you know you've got something very great you're dealing with. premier represents a tremendous breakthrough in cigarette technology that will give us a decided edge in the marketplace premier is a real leg up on the competition philip morris can't match it neither can brown & williamson are any other tobacco company with unique and important benefits to offer today's smoker premiere should capture a significant share of market. i'm excited about premier as the first of a new generation of advanced technology products that will position our jr for the future with the ever building pressure of our industry premier is a timely and positive step in advancing our role as leaders in innovation in the cigarette business. okay i'll tell you the thing that i remember the most is after working with a very small staff of people for the first couple of years one person growing to three and then about five and going through a lot of different ideas that didn't pan out somebody ran into my office one day and they said my god come to the lab come to the lab now we've got to show you something and i went and what they showed me was the concept of became premier and that's to me that was the best day coming from tobacco field which was quite an honor to work on the world's largest most modern cigarette factory to come to this project which now is the transition like going from chewing tobacco to a cigarette is that major transition and see this exciting challenge both for the manufacturing process and for the marketing and sales force it really gives the marketing and sales people another alternative offered to all the smokers he should sell it and mark it and push it fast. and that's really what this past year has been about what we have worked very very hard and developing what we feel is the very best promotional plan ever executed by reynolds tobacco whether the programs are delivered at retail or through direct mail they're all specifically designed to make sure that each smoker has a quality trial experience with premier and to make sure that they understand about the product and know the benefits that premier brings to them so i guess now it's time for for us to reap the rewards of our efforts someone was asking me the other day what am i going to do when when this product goes to market and what i'd like to do is to be able to just sit down have a drink or two or three and watch the product fly off the shelf because i think it will we

and and this whole issue of public information and we're very very fortunate to have you here i want to if you would to dr. bloom i'm going to yield a send a durenberger who has another committee meeting at the present time and has individual who be coming up after after you but he's going to necessarily have to absent himself i'd like to call on him now whether he had introduced the commissioner of health minnesota department of health and we'll include that introduction to the appropriate place in the record chairman thank you very much appreciate your doing this we do have a hearing on underground storage tanks and your mention of allan bloom is a work listen to the testimony of previous witnesses late again to see senator dodd with whom i had the privilege of serving in the house number of years ago we would just like to offer our complete statement for the record we understand the it'll be received and we've been asked to summarize i'd like to mention the fact that i have with me mr. floyd abrams who is leading expert in the constitutional aspects of advertising he's taught first amendment law at yale and columbia law school's and at the columbia graduate school of journalism and i think mr. abrams has argued more cases before the us supreme court involved in freedom of the press and any lawyer in american history is widely published we had hoped that he would have an opportunity to testify we've been told that due to the pressure of time that won't be possible but he's with me today he has submitted a statement for the record and we hope that it'll be you'll be afforded an opportunity to respond to questions specifically on the subject of advertising mr. chairman dr. sullivan's statement was long and eloquent but his bottom line was that he does not see a need for the legislation that is the subject of this hearing today and one of the reasons for that was all of the things that are already in place nobody opposes education what do you marik and public including youngsters already educated to the perceived health hazards of smoking a despite what a number of witnesses have said here this morning independent survey research including that originated by hhs in 1985 demonstrates that not only have 98 percent of americans heard that smoking is a health threat 95 percent believed it increases the risk of lung cancer 92% believed it increases the risk of emphysema and 91% believed it increased the risk of heart disease and mr. chairman instead of changing warning labels letting the states tamper with national standard advertising policy requiring long list of ingredients to be provided a bureaucrats in the public creating a new bureaucracy and spending hundreds of millions of dollars of public funds badly needed for hundreds of other critical purposes consider the programs already in place they include as dr. sullivan mentioned this morning their office of smoking and health established pursuant to the smoking and health act of 1984 dr. sullivan i believe said that that office is very active and intends to remain active and even to increase its level of activity you have i think you held it up there this morning mr. chairman the list of ingredients in cigarettes already been provided had to hhs is required by the same act and let me save mr. chairman and the industry and the individual companies have submitted five separate lists of ingredients there has been communication back and forth between the office of smoking and health and the secretary's office and the companies over this time with specific questions about those ingredients dr. sullivan said this morning that recently the department had decided that it needed quantitative information nation about ingredients they wrote a representative of the industry last week and two days later the industry responded i don't suppose that secretary and seeing that this morning indicated that he had not but two days later the industry responded that that quantitative information would be forthcoming and offered again to work and cooperate with the secretary to the degree that he felt was necessary to make any sensual determinations about ingredients and the secretary is already mandated by the smoking and health act of 1984 to report to congress whatever findings and recommendations he feels unnecessary in connection with ingredients or further disclosure of ingredients or additions or deletions of ingredients so that's already going on in the case of nicotine tar and carbon monoxide there's a laboratory which is owned and operated by the tobacco but which is monitored on a daily basis by the federal trade commission that uses a method approved by the federal trade commission to test what are nicotine and carbon monoxide that information is already available to ftc an annual list is published showing what brands contain what levels of tar and nicotine and tobacco cigarette advertisement is country is required to show the tar and nicotine content so that's already being taken care of their laws and regulations all the way from the some of those we mentioned and others from the national government to small municipalities and i think anybody would be struck this morning and listening to what's going on you mentioned mr. chairman activities in boston in massachusetts new england intensive state and local effort doing additional regulatory work and increasing the level of regulation of cigarette smoking to do in bergen sister ashton and others mentioned minnesota and the midwest senator hatch mentioned his area you and others even mentioned states like virginia and north carolina which have tobacco states so we don't believe that has been demonstrated a great need to provide money to states to step up their level of activity they already have an extremely high level of activity and his sister ashton speaking for all association of state governments indicated that level is increasing all the time in addition to that we have the annual reports by the surgeon general on smoking and health and is a brand new report that we saw for the first time when we walked in this morning these annual reports not only recite to extensive summers of epidemiological studies but consistently and deliberately draw very dire conclusions from these studies and they seemed to grow more surreal every year and these are highly publicized by the media and elsewhere then their extensive highly publicized well organized and will faint financed antismoking campaigns in the private sector we're familiar with those with mentioned this morning the great american smokeout which is an annual events perfect example many of us and all the major news media very quick to give extensive coverage to antismoking laws and is smoking campaigns and health claims no matter how reasonable unreasonable they may be but you might raise a question senator well if these things you should going on they're not working they're not accomplishing the desired result well let's point out a few results that have been accomplished the prevalence of smoking by dogs since 1965 according to the surgeon general's report has dropped from 40% to 29% one out of every two americans who smoke has quit between 1965 and 1985 41 million americans quit smoking 90% of those our chairman alone without any outside help this is according to the surgeon general's own report 1988 this certainly doesn't sound like tobacco has the same addictive qualities as heroin and cocaine when half the people who ever smoked have quit certainly you can't say that about habitual users of hard drugs by 1985 the group of exsmokers in this country outnumbered people who smoked more than 25 cigarettes a day by threetoone margin that comes from the 1988 you stay statistical abstract concerns been expressed about young people the prevalence of daily smoking among high school students drop from 29 percent to 21 percent between 1976 and 1980 and has fluctuated between 18 and 21 percent since that time and mr. chairman as far back as 1979 the surgeon general said in his report on smoking and health by the time they reach the seventh grade the vast majority charity of children believe not have heard but believe that smoking is dangerous to one's health that's a direct quote as recently as 1987 a survey reported in the journal of the american medical association found that of 895 children and adolescents questioned over 98 percent said they believed smoking is harmful and this again is a direct quote accurately named one or more body parts that are adversely affected by smoking in short americans young and old in all sectors and in all socioeconomic groups has been educated to the alleged health risks of smoking and a sizable majority has elected to stop smoking or not to start others have chosen to assume whatever risk exists just as many americans knowingly assume other risks that are a part of their chosen lifestyle let me talk just a minute to mr. chairman about advertising it's been an allegation after allegation here that we've heard over and over from the antitobacco forces that the cigarette industry advertising is with the deliberate purpose in mind of inducing young people and others to begin smoking to in effect expand the market of smokers now let me address that just a minute we have always advertise just like every other industry advertisers particularly for a mature product the product that's been out there a long time not a brand new product that we try to inform people about for the first time and that is our individual companies which are highly competitive they're probably the most competitive countries companies in the american merchandising arena today their competition is is very intense and they're out there fighting for market share they're out there fighting to induce people who smoke too smoke their brand to induce those who already smoked their brand to retain that brand loyalty and that's the purpose of the advertising i want to quote again dr. coups report of 1989 this again is a direct quote there is no scientifically rigorous study available to the public that provides a definitive answer to the basic question of where the advertising and promotion increased the level of tobacco consumption this is an admission by the surgeon general that there is no significant empirical evidence that advertisers increases the level of consumption the 1987 report to the president of the council of economic advisers says this quote there is little evidence that advertising results in additional smoking as with many products advertising mainly shifts consumers among brands evidence from other countries and this is significant as well mr. chairman suggests that banning tobacco advertising has not banning advertising has not discouraged i want a quote now michael perch chunk the former chairman of the federal trade commission and a leading antismoking advocates and he said this no one pretends that advertising is a major determinant of smoking in this country or any other now those are the facts mr. chairman as admitted by responsible public officials that advertising does not serve the purpose of increasing the level of smoking but dead it is the tool by which the company's attempt to retain or gain market share let me say just one other thing on the subject of advertising mr. chairman some of our companies this morning and otherwise have been severely castigated by what's been described as targeted advertising you know you in your bill mr. chairman this committee and your legislation really does the same thing you legislation tries to look and see who it is who is smoking cigarettes and then target program to those groups to encourage them not to smoke cigarettes i think every manufactured products sold in this country mature products that are out there if you start to introduce a new model of automobile for example you're going to season you want to compete with the ford taurus just to pick something out of the air general motors is going to compete with it you're going to hire marketing and you're going to look and find out who it is it's buying the ford taurus now and what those people are looking for in a car and then you've got to target your marketing and your advertising scheme accordingly why should it be any different in the cigarette industry i would remind the chairman and the committee that there is a legitimate market out there a women who smoke cigarettes is not trying to persuade women who don't smoke the smoke but if you manufacture and sell cigarettes tourette's and there's an established market out there women smokers why is it somehow different for a cigarette manufacturer to target an existing market than it is for other companies to target an existing market we just fail to understand the difference between our industry which is selling a lawful product on a lawful market and other industries which are selling the lawful product on a lawful market mr. chairman this is a long building are a lot of different provisions in it i'm not going to trespass further on your time i will stop my prepared statement at this time and be glad to respond to questions that you have ,"the vineyards and in the issues of advertising and and this whole issue of public information and we're very very fortunate to have you here i want to if you would to dr. bloom i'm going to yield a send a durenberger who has another committee meeting at the present time and has individual who be coming up after after you but he's going to necessarily have to absent himself i'd like to call on him now whether he had introduced the commissioner of health minnesota department of health and we'll include that introduction to the appropriate place in the record chairman thank you very much i appreciate your doing this we do have a hearing on underground storage tanks and your mention of allan bloom is a work listen to the testimony of previous witnesses late again to see senator dodd with whom i had the privilege of serving in the house number of years ago we would just like to offer our complete statement for the record we understand the it'll be received and we've been asked to summarize i'd like to mention the fact that i have with me mr. floyd abrams who is leading expert in the constitutional aspects of advertising he's taught first amendment law at yale and columbia law school's and at the columbia graduate school of journalism and i think mr. abrams has argued more cases before the us supreme court involved in freedom of the press and any lawyer in american history is widely published we had hoped that he would have an opportunity to testify we've been told that due to the pressure of time that won't be possible but he's with me today he has submitted a statement for the record and we hope that it'll be you'll be afforded an opportunity to respond to questions specifically on the subject of advertising mr. chairman dr. sullivan's statement was long and eloquent but his bottom line was that he does not see a need for the legislation that is the subject of this hearing today and one of the reasons for that was all of the things that are already in place nobody opposes education but the american public including youngsters already educated to the perceived health hazards of smoking a despite what a number of witnesses have said here this morning independent survey research including that originated by hhs in 1985 demonstrates that not only have 98 percent of americans heard that smoking is a health threat 95 percent believed it increases the risk of lung cancer 92% believed it increases the risk of emphysema and 91% believed it increased the risk of heart disease and mr. chairman instead of changing warning labels letting the states tamper with national standard advertising policy requiring long list of ingredients to be provided a bureaucrats in the public creating a new bureaucracy and spending hundreds of millions of dollars of public funds badly needed for hundreds of other critical purposes consider the programs already in place they include as dr. sullivan mentioned this morning their office of smoking and health established pursuant to the smoking and health act of 1984 dr. sullivan i believe said that that office is very active and intends to remain active and even to increase its level of activity you have i think you held it up there this morning mr. chairman the list of ingredients in cigarettes already been provided to hhs is required by the same act and let me save mr. chairman and the industry and the individual companies have submitted five separate lists of ingredients there has been communication back and forth between the office of smoking and health and the secretary's office and the companies over this time with specific questions about those ingredients dr. sullivan said this morning that recently the department had decided that it needed quantitative information about ingredients they wrote a representative of the industry last week and two days later the industry responded i don't suppose that secretary had seen that this morning indicated that he had not but two days later the industry responded that that quantitative information would be forthcoming and offered again to work and cooperate with the secretary to the degree that he felt was necessary to make any sensual determinations about ingredients and the secretary is already mandated by the smoking and health act of 1984 to report to congress whatever findings and recommendations he feels unnecessary in connection with ingredients or further disclosure of ingredients or additions or deletions of ingredients so that's already going on in the case of nicotine tar and carbon monoxide there's a laboratory which is owned and operated by the tobacco institute but which is monitored on a daily basis by the federal trade commission that uses a method approved by the federal trade commission to test that tar nicotine and carbon monoxide that information is already available to ftc an annual list is published showing what brands contain what levels of tar and nicotine and tobacco cigarette advertisement this country is required to show the tar and nicotine content so that's already being taken care of their laws and regulations all the way from the some of those we mentioned and others from the national government to small municipalities and i think anybody would be struck this morning and listening to what's going on you mentioned mr. chairman activities in boston in massachusetts new england intensive state and local effort doing additional regulatory work and increasing the level of regulation of cigarette smoking to do in bergen sister ashton and others mentioned minnesota and the midwest senator hatch mentioned his area you and others even mentioned states like virginia and north carolina which have tobacco states so we don't believe that has been demonstrated a great need to provide money to states to step up their level of activity they already have an extremely high level of activity and his sister ashton speaking for all association of state governments indicated that level is increasing all the time in addition to that we have the annual reports by the surgeon general on smoking and health and is a brand new report that we saw for the first time when we walked in this morning these annual reports not only recite to extensive summers of epidemiological studies but consistently and deliberately draw very dire conclusions from these studies and they seemed to grow more surreal every year and these are highly publicized by the media and elsewhere then their extensive highly publicized well organized and will  financed antismoking campaigns in the private sector we're familiar with those with mentioned this morning the great american smokeout which is an annual events perfect example many of us and all the major news media very quick to give extensive coverage to antismoking laws and antismoking campaigns and health claims no matter how reasonable unreasonable they may be but you might raise a question senator well if these things are going on they're not working they're not accomplishing the desired result well let's point out a few results that have been accomplished the prevalence of smoking by adults since 1965 according to the surgeon general's report has dropped from 40% to 29% one out of every two americans who smoke has quit between 1965 and 1985 41 million americans quit smoking 90% of those mr. chairman alone without any outside help this is according to the surgeon general's own report 1988 this certainly doesn't sound like tobacco has the same addictive qualities as heroin and cocaine when half the people who ever smoked have quit certainly you can't say that about habitual users of hard drugs by 1985 the group of exsmokers in this country outnumbered people who smoked more than 25 cigarettes a day by threetoone margin that comes from the 1988 united states statistical abstract concerns been expressed about young people the prevalence of daily smoking among high school students drop from 29 percent to 21 percent between 1976 and 1980 and has fluctuated between 18 and 21 percent since that time and mr. chairman as far back as 1979 the surgeon general said in his report on smoking and health by the time they reach the seventh grade the vast majority of children believe not have heard but believe that smoking is dangerous to one's health that's a direct quote as recently as 1987 a survey reported in the journal of the american medical association found that of 895 children and adolescents questioned over 98 percent said they believed smoking is harmful and this again is a direct quote accurately named one or more body parts that are adversely affected by smoking in short americans young and old in all sectors and in all socioeconomic groups has been educated to the alleged health risks of smoking and a sizable majority has elected to stop smoking or not to start others have chosen to assume whatever risk exists just as many americans knowingly assume other risks that are a part of their chosen lifestyle let me talk just a minute to mr. chairman about advertising it's been an allegation after allegation here that we've heard over and over from the antitobacco forces that the cigarette industry advertising is with the deliberate purpose in mind of inducing young people and others to begin smoking to in effect expand the market of smokers now let me address that just a minute we have always advertise just like every other industry advertisers particularly for a mature product the product that's been out there a long time not a brand new product that we try to inform people about for the first time and that is our individual companies which are highly competitive they're probably the most competitive countries companies in the american merchandising arena today their competition is is very intense and they're out there fighting for market share they're out there fighting to induce people who smoke too smoke their brand to induce those who already smoked their brand to retain that brand loyalty and that's the purpose of the advertising i want to quote again dr. coups report of 1989 this again is a direct quote there is no scientifically rigorous study available to the public that provides a definitive answer to the basic question of where the advertising and promotion increased the level of tobacco consumption this is an admission by the surgeon general that there is no significant empirical evidence that advertisers increases the level of consumption the 1987 report to the president of the council of economic advisers says this quote there is little evidence that advertising results in additional smoking as with many products advertising mainly shifts consumers among brands evidence from other countries and this is significant as well m r. chairman suggests that banning tobacco advertising has not banning advertising has not discouraged smoking i want a quote now michael perch chunk the former chairman of the federal trade commission and a leading antismoking advocates and he said this no one pretends that advertising is a major determinant of smoking in this country or any other now those are the facts mr. chairman as admitted by responsible public officials that advertising does not serve the purpose of increasing the level of smoking but instead it is the tool by which the company's attempt to retain or gain market share let me say just one other thing on the subject of advertising mr. chairman some of our companies this morning and otherwise have been severely castigated by what's been described as targeted advertising you know you in your bill mr. chairman this committee and your legislation really does the same thing your legislation tries to look and see who it is who is smoking cigarettes and then target program to those groups to encourage them not to smoke cigarettes i think every manufactured products sold in this country mature products that are out there if you start to introduce a new model of automobile for example you're going to season you want to compete with the ford taurus just to pick something out of the air general motors is going to compete with it you're going to hire marketing and you're going to look and find out who it is it's buying the ford taurus now and what those people are looking for in a car and then you've got to target your marketing and your advertising scheme accordingly why should it be any different in the cigarette industry i would remind the chairman and the committee that there is a legitimate market out there of women who smoke cigarettes is not trying to persuade women who don't smoke to smoke but if you manufacture and sell cigarettes and there's an established market out there women smokers why is it somehow different for a cigarette manufacturer to target an existing market than it is for other companies to target an existing market we just fail to understand the difference between our industry which is selling a lawful product on a lawful market and other industries which are selling the lawful product on a lawful market mr. chairman this is a long bill there are a lot of different provisions in it i'm not going to trespass further on your time i will stop my prepared statement at this time and be glad to respond to questions that you have.

geography dynamic brands generating unforgettable excitement a very strong defenses on the merits if we have to go to trial in the merits we expect to win i think it's interesting that if you look at what judge jones did in the castano case you'd have to conclude that the plaintiffs lawyers can't be very happy about it either because he has created a situation in which they cannot expect even if they prevail to collect the first dime of damages if they win for decades because the first thing they have to go through is first of all sending notice to the class which will probably end up costing them several million dollars they will then have to have discovery on the common issues that he is certified they will then have to have a trial on those common issues before a jury and even if they win some issues in that common in that common issue trial they still won't collect anything because they're then going to have to go and try millions of individual cases or cases around the country this is clearly not the game plan that they had in mind i'm sure what they had in mind was trying to get a classwide certification on everything in the hope that that would terrorize the industry into some sort of quick settlement and as i've indicated before they're up against the wrong industry on that we don't intend to do that larry adelman from dean witter irrespective of the litigation llook i wonder whether the twenty percent successful spinoff of reynolds food business nabisco has in any way changed your thoughts about the spinoff of your food businesses the answer that is no our own observation don't suggest that any values passed through to our jails its early days larry's so one would need to wait and see but the answer right now is no he's a question excuse me if i could go back to a litigation question your you've mentioned a couple times that under castano there would be the requirement for millions of individual trials obviously the plaintiffs don't expect that and they're hoping for some sort of sampling and extrapolation methodology what's the likelihood of something like that and secondly do you agree that this you know decision will be important to the fifth circuit in determining whether sampling is is acceptable and therefore this case could therefore be manageable well let me say first of all i think it's quite interesting that judge jones in his opinion said nothing about sampling her an extrapolation is in fact if you read his opinion carefully i think the only conclusion you can come to is that the way he's thinking about it now is there would have to be individual trials because he said that very clearly under the seventh amendment were entitled to a jury trial on all of the individual issues that he refused to certify now that doesn't mean that down the road he may not take another look at it and in that connection i think what the fifth circuit does in shamino could be relevant judge parker you as you know has been grappling with that shamino fiberboard situation for years and he has repeatedly tried to come up with some formula that will help him to dispose of not millions of cases but only 3 000 cases and he still has not succeeded the last extrapolation exercise that he engaged in as you know is what is now on appeal to the fifth circuit in the gym i know case i understand that the argument in that case went very well from the defendants point of view and i think there's a good likelihood that the fifth circuit will have serious concerns about what judge parker did but even if they should affirm in some way some of what judge parker did i don't think that creates a precedent for our situation because you have as i said in shamino only 3 000 members of the class in our situation you're going to have upwards of 50 60 70 million members of the class and i don't think it's going to be easy to develop some sort of a test case extrapolation theory upon which to try those cases you know in castano the judge did ask the plaintiffs to submit a trial plan which they did and which was totally deficient in terms of responding to his request for something that would indicate how this is going to be handled down the road so they basically weren't responsive to the judges west and interestingly the judge never said a word about that trial plan so i think he may be waiting also to see what happens in shamino just as we all are but i think irrespective of what happens in shamino and i'm hoping and expecting a favorable result there that we have as judge jones said a sewage and eris k assuage and eris case and that i don't think anything that's happened in any other case in the past will provide any guidance for what's going to happen in this situation which is in which is incidentally why i think the fifth circuit will reverse if they if they take judge jones opinion on appeal okay will the manageability issue be compared to the less than 100 cases outstanding in the country today or will it be compared to the millions of potential lawsuits under the theory that there's millions of people who'd be in this class who have no chance of winning a suit on their own but they would if they if they could go this route which will they compare that manageability issue to i think that's a very good question and of course i always hate to predict how a court will analyze anything but it seems to me that the right way to analyze it as i tried to suggest in my comments earlier is to compare the manageability problem that is created by what joan judge jones did here in certifying a class for any purpose against the six cases that are now pending in the united states i mean the that's what i meant when i said that judge jones has really created a crisis where none existed we don't have a crisis in tobacco litigation today they're only 66 cases out there the fact of the matter is the vast majority of smokers have no interest in litigation what judge jones has done by certifying a class is to draw in tens of millions of people into a lawsuit that they never had any interest in nor probably know anything about this isn't this is not a situation where you have a lot of people out in the country looking for some remedy this is a situation where you have a group of trial lawyers who are taking some statements that were made last year by commissioner kessler and by henry waxman and trying to convert it into a big class action which will have hopefully from their point of view a big payday for them at the end and i think the fifth circuit is sophisticated enough to see that for that reason i think the per standard and i think the proper the standard they will apply is to compare the manageability of the current situation where we have 66 cases against what would be unleashed if a class action where to go forward thank you mary we haven't had any questions from the back so if there's anybody down there it's a little hard to see there's one over here okay one of the things that plaintiffs law firms are counting on to bolster their case against the tobacco companies is the discovery of a brown & williamson internal document on y1 tobacco apparently internal memos supposedly indicate that bw was trying to manufacture a brand of tobacco with twice the nicotine of tobacco with similar tar content could this undermine the tobacco industry is contention that's its knowledge nicotine is not addictive  and it's merely been produced as a byproduct in cigarette manufacturer let me say that i don't i don't think so and i don't think it should because as i said during my remarks in the in the final analysis the real question that juries look at they're not really interested too much and how you define addiction or whether cigarettes are addictive or not and there are 20 different definitions of addiction what they really look at and i think what they should look at is whether or not someone who wanted to smoke who wanted to quit tried to quit and that has come up repeatedly time and again in the cases we have taken to trial and also in the focus groups that we had and mock trials that we have around the country there's been a lot written about these brown and williamson documents i'm not intimately familiar with them but and more importantly i'm not intimately familiar with what the authors of those documents would say and i think that's very significant the brown & williamson counsel advised us that they believe all of those documents are explain ebola and that certainly doesn't surprise me because that was our own experience in the chip alone case where the plaintiff's lawyer repeatedly would take little sig segments or snippets out of context would go to the media and say look what we found here this is a clear indication that the industry is engaged in misconduct but the fact of the matter is when we got to trial and the jury had an opportunity to see all of the documents and not simply little excerpts taken out of context and to hear the explanations of the people who wrote those documents they ended up finding in the defendants favor and i would expect that will continue to happen with respect not only to our own documents but to bmws documents and other documents thank you mary any more questions he's one of it here in the abc litigation it's not quite clear to me what your ultimate goal is is it a slap in the risk and some public humiliation or is your position moving towards one of some economic pain towards the defendants in that case are you from abc with wellington management but our goal is to own abc and hopefully that will increase the bonuses to the legal department seriously let me say this we brought that lawsuit in part out of a sense of total outrage about the lies that were contained in that program and in part to vindicate ourselves because we think that that program has had a significant impact on the way up in ian leaders and congressmen and the public think of us and in part two as part of that vindication to secure damages we did not we did not bring that lawsuit lightly we did not do it for a publicrelations ploy we did not do it because we wanted to put the media on the defensive as some people have said we did it because we thought abc was outrageous that they lied they knew they lied and we think we're going to be would approve that and we thought long and hard about what to ask for in terms of damages and frankly i don't think ten billion dollars is too much when you consider the damage that that pro that those programs have had thank you mary now we are getting to adjourn outside and there are drinks and so forth and we would like you to be able to talk to all of us so i can take two or three more questions before we do that if you like and then we can go outside lee because i'm supposed to introduce myself i'm lee first from sg warburg and my question is about the combination of american tobacco and brown and williamson can you comment on how that's changed the competitive landscape for instance will you still try to maintain a premium for basic over other discounted brands from allah jimmy answer jimmy the u. s. cigarette industry is characterized in my judgment as an industry that had six companies in it any one of whom at any given moment could start something that was problematic for us or anybody else it's an industry where each company has had successes over the years and i believe the significance of the merger or acquisition of american brands by brown & williamson goes something like this the good news is there's one less competitor in the industry so we have five companies instead of six the bad news is that there's one stronger competitor in the industry and that's the combination of american brands and brown and williamson which now is a company that has somewhere between a 17 and 18 percent market share it will definitely be a stronger company they have stronger asset base they have salesforce assets and they have operating efficiencies that are available to them however it's interesting that with all our scale as philip morris we cannot get every brand displayed at retail in fact arguably we have trouble getting more than three brands displayed in a really good position at retail so i'm not sure whether this new and company is going to be able to reach out with its increased size and do a heck of a lot more in the marketplace than brown and williamson was able to do on its own however we respect that company we respect them as a formidable worldwide competitor and they are definitely stronger in the united states market so our antenna or up and we'll watch it play out and we will continue to trade basic at a premium as we showed one more question yeah mark cohen from goldman sachs jeff you know you've done all the right things since since last august grown the earnings rapidly you raise a dividend you initiated a stock buyback but the stock hasn't moved and i'm wondering how that experience affects the way you think about the financial resources that are available to your options that are available to you you know in a nonoperating sense to build that value of it has hesitated your taste for dividend hikes and share or change your thinking in any way well firstly maybe i got it wrong but the stock was 15 it's now 60 so that's 10 bucks that's 20% so i feel pretty good about that and that's in eight months so fact i keep that up every eight months i'd be thrilled mates bill murray and i outlined a strategy which are repeated here and we said that in june listen there are two things we're going to do we got to grow the business provide the cash to reinvest back in the business and we will then distribute the rest to the shareholders and we have been doing that and i don't think there is a company in the world in fact i know there isn't a company in the world that has given more to its shareholders in the past year than philip morris has given to its shareholders in the past year i do believe that there has been uptick in the stock and i think given the seven increases in the interest rates that we've experienced that we would have seen a higher increase in the stock if it hadn't been for that so getting from 50 to 60 in the environment we've been in and given seven interest rate hikes i think it's pretty good my own sense is as people see how the litigation begins to unfold about which we feel confident the robustness of our business which we've attempted to describe to you the day and hour going forward policy and as i said to you as i see our business is continuing to grow and throw off cash will be recommending to the to the directors how we think that money should be dished out and we have two things in mind one reinvest in the business to grow the business and to return the money to the shareholders it hasn't tainted my view let me tell you i feel pretty good about how its concert for am i wrong about the 50 60 i have a plaque to prove it my point was more not not not an absolute price but the multiple stock price multiple still being fairly compressed relative to where it has been and and your satisfaction with that they look you're right about that and i think we would all agree that the issue is the litigation and how it affects the valuation within the stock price valuation the domestic tobacco business so you have to see how that unfolds put that aside the rest of the business couldn't be in better shape so one just has to go through the period letting that thing take its course and the next important thing i feel is what was discussed here today what happens in the gym you know case we'll see what happens then we'll move forward on that and see how things unfold beyond that we'd like the stock that i said i think i believe the stock is highly undervalued i mean on any measure it's highly undervalued but some of it's out of our control i mind you i should add and i didn't completely answer gary's question we've never planned for failure in this company we've always planned for success we plan to grow the businesses infinitely we plan to win the litigation and we plan to grow shareholder returns year after year generation after generation and that is our plan well on that note let me close the meeting in thank you very much for coming and being with us today and please have a drink,rises above barriers of language and geography dynamic brands generating unforgettable excitement. a very strong defenses on the merits if we have to go to trial in the merits we expect to win i think it's interesting that if you look at what judge jones did in the castano case you'd have to conclude that the plaintiffs lawyers can't be very happy about

those documents are explainable and that certainly doesn't surprise me because that was our own experience in the chip alone case where the plaintiff's lawyer repeatedly would take little sig segments or snippets out of context would go to the media and say look what we found here this is a clear indication that the industry is engaged in misconduct but the fact of the matter is when we got to trial and the jury had an opportunity to see all of the documents and not simply little excerpts taken out of context and to hear the explanations of the people who wrote those documents they ended up finding in the defendants favor and i would expect that will continue to happen with respect not only to our own documents but to bmws documents and other documents thank you mary any more questions he's over here in the abc litigation it's not quite clear to me what your ultimate goal is is it a slap in the risk and some public humiliation or is your position moving towards one of some economic pain towards the defendants in that case are you from abc with wellington management but our goal is to own abc and hopefully that will increase the bonuses to the legal department seriously let me say this we brought that lawsuit in part out of a sense of total outrage about the lies that were contained in that program and in part to vindicate ourselves because we think that that program has had a significant impact on the way opinion  leaders and congressmen and the public think of us and in part to as part of that vindication to secure damages we did not we did not bring that lawsuit lightly we did not do it for a publicrelations ploy we did not do it because we wanted to put the media on the defensive as some people have said we did it because we thought abc was outrageous that they lied they knew they lied and we think we're going to be would prove that and we thought long and hard about what to ask for in terms of damages and frankly i don't think ten billion dollars is too much when you consider the damage that that pro that those programs have had thank you mory now we are getting to adjourn outside and there are drinks and so forth and we would like you to be able to talk to all of us so i can take two or three more questions before we do that if you like and then we can go outside lee i guess i'm supposed to introduce myself i'm lee first from sg warburg and my question is about the combination of american tobacco and brown and williamson can you comment on how that's changed the competitive landscape for instance will you still try to maintain a premium for basic over other discounted brands from jimmy answer jimmy the u. s. cigarette industry is characterized in my judgment as an industry that had six companies in it any one of whom at any given moment could start something that was problematic for us or anybody else it's an industry where each company has had successes over the years and i believe the significance of the merger or acquisition of american brands by brown & williamson goes something like this the good news is there's one less competitor in the industry so we have five companies instead of six the bad news is that there's one stronger competitor in the industry and that's the combination of american brands and brown and williamson which now is a company that has somewhere between a 17 and 18 percent market share it will definitely be a stronger company they have stronger asset base they have salesforce assets and they have operating efficiencies that are available to them however it's interesting that with all our scale as philip morris we cannot get every brand displayed at retail in fact arguably we have trouble getting more than three brands displayed in a really good position at retail so i'm not sure whether this new and company is going to be able to reach out with its increased size and do a heck of a lot more in the marketplace than brown and williamson was able to do on its own however we respect that company we respect them as a formidable worldwide competitor and they are definitely stronger in the united states market so our antenna or up and we'll watch it play out and we will continue to trade basic at a premium as we showed one more question yeah mark cohen from goldman sachs jeff you know you've done all the right things since since last august you've grown the earnings rapidly you raise a dividend you initiated a stock buyback but the stock hasn't moved and i'm wondering how that experience affects the way you think about the financial resources that are available to your options that are available to you you know in a nonoperating sense to build that value of it has hesitated your taste for dividend hikes and share or change your thinking in any way well firstly maybe i got it wrong but the stock was 15 it's now 60 so that's 10 bucks that's 20% so i feel pretty good about that and that's in eight months so fact i keep that up every eight months i'd be thrilled mates bill murray and i outlined a strategy which are repeated here and we said that in june listen there are two things we're going to do we got to grow the business provide the cash to reinvest back in the business and we will then distribute the rest to the shareholders and we have been doing that and i don't think there is a company in the world in fact i know there isn't a company in the world that has given more to its shareholders in the past year than philip morris has given to its shareholders in the past year i do believe that there has been uptick in the stock and i think given the seven increases in the interest rates that we've experienced that we would have seen a higher increase in the stock if it hadn't been for that so getting from 50 to 60 in the environment we've been in and given seven interest rate hikes i think it's pretty good my own sense is as people see how the litigation begins to unfold about which we feel confident the robustness of our business which we've attempted to describe to you the day and our going forward policy and as i said to you as i see our business is continuing to grow and throw off cash will be recommending to the to the directors how we think that money should be dished out and we have two things in mind one reinvest in the business to grow the business and to return the money to the shareholders it hasn't tainted my view let me tell you i feel pretty good about how its gone so far am i wrong about the 50 60 i have a plaque to prove it my point was more not not not an absolute price but the multiple stock price multiple still being fairly compressed relative to where it has been and and your satisfaction with that they look you're right about that and i think we would all agree that the issue is the litigation and how it affects the valuation within the stock price valuation the domestic tobacco business so you have to see how that unfolds put that aside the rest of the business couldn't be in better shape so one just has to go through the period letting that thing take its course and the next important thing i feel is what was discussed here today what happens in the shamino you know case we'll see what happens then we'll move forward on that and see how things unfold beyond that we'd like the stock that i said i think i believe the stock is highly undervalued i mean on any measure it's highly undervalued but some of it's out of our control i mind you i should add and i didn't completely answer gary's question we've never planned for failure in this company we've always planned for success we plan to grow the businesses infinitely we plan to win the litigation and we plan to grow shareholder returns year after year generation after generation and that is our plan well on that note let me close the meeting in thank you very much for coming and being with us today and please have a drink with us

conference my name is john scanlan i would like to introduce the group of people up here on my immediate right is officer stevens who is general counsel for lorillard on his right is marie bring acting general counsel for philip morris on his right is picked on his right is peter blakely of arnold & porter of washington and counsel for philip morris on peters right is steve parrish of shook hardy and bacon a kansas city law firm representing lorillard and on steve parrish is right is chuck wall of the same firm chapati and bacon and kansas city representing lorelai time philip morris author stevens will begin the proceedings he will make a statement he will introduce mary bring will make a statement and then be available for questions of any kind thank you good morning and thank you very much for coming john thank you well the verdict in the chip alone case is clearly a victory for the cigarette manufacturer and any effort to characterize it otherwise is a distortion this case was trumpeted by the plaintiffs bar for years and years to be the acid test the cigarette product liability litigation the plaintiffs three law firms are padded and litigated it for five years and took almost all of its 18 the trial duration for the presentation of their case in doing so they observed no scruple in their effort to defame and to discredit the entire tobacco industry and the three defendant tobacco companies before the jury they failed to do so not only did they fail to prove their most critical assertion they also failed in their quest of punitive damages and they failed in the face of every possible assistance that they could receive from a court which was demonstrable e hostile tobacco companies at the outset and which gave the plaintiff's counsel enormous latitude and consistently preferential rulings many of which were unwarranted or the customary rules of evidence and procedure this victory is also important because it sends a message to lawyers and to plaintiff that jury will not allow them to recap to reap huge financial windfall by suing unreasonable product liability losses and in that sense i urge you to view with skepticism any plane that this verdict is really a victory for the plaintiff and his law firms the plaintiffs law firms invested by their own admission over two million dollars from their own time and their own money to bring this case to trial and what do they have to show for it on the narrow and technical basis of an express warranty allegedly made by liggett over 22 years ago the jury awarded a few hundred thousand dollars to miss the trip alone in light of the jury's other decisions that certainly sounds like an illogical and a curious award and it suggests at least to me that the jury somehow felt some sympathy for mr. chip alone that result we are told by liggett is going to be peeled and we have every confidence that it will be reversed on appeal this is a clear demonstration that those that these cases are just not worth pursuing and i suspect that the six or so of the plaintiff law firms that are handling the majority of these cases around the country will kick quickly come to the same conclusion reviewing this case remember that this jury completely exonerated all of the defenders lorillard go are and ligand of the principal charges one of the companies fraudulently misrepresented and concealed material facts concerning health risks associated with cigarette smoking and to that the company's conspire prior to 1966 to misrepresent for concealed material facts about cigarette smoking and health or three companies were exonerated of those charges furthermore we have heard much from the plaintiff's counsel and his colleagues throughout about the socalled secret company document they were going to reveal and they were going to prove the conspiracy alleged by the point well it's abundantly clear that the jury completely rejected the distorted and the peace filled piecemeal misrepresentation of those company documents made by plaintiff's counsel when they decided in favor of the companies as i said on the issues of fraud misrepresentation and conspiracy there were no smoking guns among those company patients and that red herring of an issue is now probably put to rest i want to make two more observations and then i'll turn the proceedings over to mr. bring it from mars we should all remember that the real story of this litigation it's not a woman from new jersey to smoke but about money money about three very big very rich new jersey law firms who decided to invest lots of their own time and their own money in the products liability litigation lottery sure they pose the self style champions of rose chip alone and yes they panned it to antwerp and it by the whole crew of selfappointed antitobacco post but everyone knows what they were really pursuing but it wasn't solely to benefit by the rose for tony aaa finally the most important result of this case is that on the major issues before the jurors understood the people are still responsible for their own actions and that when something unfortunate happens to them they can't just sue and say someone else's full this jury those in many other cases before the tobacco industry prior to 1988 have rejected that concept and they said freedom of choice and personal responsibility still mean something thank goodness for that it's my pleasure to introduce marie bring the chief legal officer fillmore you still have your name please bri ng just like i said thank you arthur and thank you all so so much on behalf of philip morris i'd like to welcome you to this press conference he's general counsel on appeal or the beginning that this is a press conference that we had planned before any verdict came in because we were anxious to have this opportunity to set the record straight we obviously could not do that while the trial was going on despite the fact that there had been many irresponsible charges leveled against philip morris and the rest of the industry not only by mystery dale but by mr. dinard and others who are prominent in the antitobacco ranks we were very anxious to have this opportunity to tell our side of the story and in that connection most of you i'm sure received when you came in a memorandum that has been prepared and is available to any of you who do not have it and it tries to set in context the socalled chip alone documents and it tries to demonstrate as i think is clearly the case that not only philip morris but the entire industry has acted responsibly during the past 30 some years since the smoking and health controversy has been raging we're delighted to have this opportunity to set the record straight to tell our side of the story and to answer any questions that you might have concerning any of this litigation and particularly the documents about which so much has been written in the past four months i noticed in much of the press today relating to the chip alone verdict that there have been some statements of confusion expressed by not only journalists but by other people who follow this industry and follow the litigation and there seems to be at least prevalent among some the notion that this is a confused verdict it's complicated it and it's not clear exactly what the verdict means i'd like to take just a minute before we address any questions you might have to try to tell you from philip morris's perspective how we view this verdict ,good morning and thank you for coming to our press conference my name is john

remained correct to follow up on the line of questioning at the chairman ask and let me go to mr. aiken know mr. aiken and know more about his operation and even though he's a little bigger than most of us in east tennessee the situation that he outlined with respect to his farming operation is pretty typical mr. aiken is it not with respect to the cost that you incur and and the amount of net profit you get per pound so i would ask god i'd be now if how many of you are still selling in tobacco auction and nobody's raising their hand all right to of course portion part a portion of portion at all but you would agree that in the way the situation is developing at auctions will soon be out of the picture you agree to that and then we'll be left to contract selling our all of you now selling under contract get there well it doesn't make sense to you that if if the fda should get into the picture and if the fda should put regulations on the manufacturers that those are simply going to be passed through to you as producers through the contracting provision how many years for those of you who've been contracting how many years have you been contracted but mr. carter had opportunity probably the contract a certain portion of my tobacco before anyone else because i grow portion of my tobacco organically and i've been under contract and that regard for six years on that portion of tobacco and that point and the point you're trying to make is that yes as time has gone by more has been demanded of what has occurred on my farm but i can assure you that the cost of regulation is of concern to growers and they certainly don't want fda intimately involved on their farm but that i can take you to three or four my neighbors whose farm i now attend because they were no longer a viable unit if they had the opportunity to advance forward with some degree of profitability and a reasonable degree of fda regulation they would rather be farming and be renting their farm and i think that's the situation that we've been placed it in its growers is it's only been 45 years since we had her plastered all over our trucks no fda on the farm and it was not a grower issue it was a cigarette manufacturer issue and we were trying to help them fight that battle and i think right now it's still currently a cigarette manufacturing issue and we're just in the situation that we've bought into the idea and firmly believe that if the air regulations coming we need to we need to proactively of that is portion of what we need to get a quote of bile and i'm not saying we were but at the same time we need to realistically understand that those contractual provisions have grown more stringent sir that in the six years that you have dealt with them and and there was no reason for them to other than the the yes sir considerations of the contract between the company and the growth yes sir and well to get that let me ask mr. mr. rat did you want to comment on that or yes of congressman jenkins there are many farmers in southwest jane i'm sure right across the line over in your area that that would like to have an opportunity to continue with auction system i've heard many say you know hey we're at the mercy of the company now we have a nap and the point that you made is that if we have to continue contracting it's going to be through that contract that a lot can be dictated by fda and whether the farmer can live with that or not i don't know time will only tell so we must be very very very cautious as we drag this legislation thank you mr. wright my time is expired mr. chairman thank you mr. jenkins gentleman from north carolina mr. mcintyre thank you mr. chairman i just like short answer this first question from each of you what will happen to you if we don't get a buy out this year will you be able to continue to produce some tobacco how i love the fact you will just go down the table for good as i look across this panel i think i'm the youngest youngest member testifying today i'm 40 years old and as i said in my testimony i made a commitment to grow tobacco i don't have a lot of other options in the east tennessee my wife and i made a commitment to work hard and and we thought we had a master plan when we got married my debt load good for the last two years has actually increased that's not completely due to the i mean there's other factors weatherrelated and those things and i accepted those going in i did not know initially when i went into the tobacco business that i would be looking at the uncertainties that we have in the last couple of years i still need to produce tobacco i still want to produce tobacco but i would hope that we could get some more stability congressman obviously most of us would anticipate if there's not a quota by all that we do experience another massive quota cut i think that my situation must be fairly similar to mr. akins just a year or two older than he is we thought we made a very conscious plan realizing that the industry was changing we've invested we thought prudently and position ourselves for the future in the industry there's no way that you can plan for 50 and 60 percent quota cuts no matter how prudent you our thank you congressman i'm sure help will still be producing buckle but at the last level than i am now in 1998 99 are produced 192 thousand pounds this year i'm down to 105 thousand pound i'm sure that's going to be less next year now i'm also diverse find out into a bigger cattle operation how to will continue to raise the debacle but the problem mentioned how small we were for with the cuts we've had in the last few years i've actually picked up lisa's every year but yet i'm less the bog of than i was four or five years ago if i look at it scares me sometimes when i look at the land that's under my control it's over 1 000 acres and i'm raising 25 x to the bike that's how much farmland is tied up and at some of grand some of that is temple and a lot of it past you land but you guys will continue have to raise the bike if i'm going to say that cost will continue to go up producers will have less and less net income as a result and will become less and less competitive in these global markets that we're forced to compete in these days barney to buy quotas in southwest virginia very small to start with and this year i would say that probably 200 acres of tobacco was not put out in washington county alone just because the quotas had been shrunken so much that it wasn't profitable to go out there and put out a half acre tobacco which is about the size of a for washington county with jenny the county i live in all will i be raising the back and next year next year will only tell if things continue to go the way they have the last five years we're going to be out in southwest virginia thank you very much and mr. chairman the interest of time i would just ask on each of the panelists given the importance of the buyout that if for some reason we did not get a buyout we're going to be left with having to deal with the current program and that concerns all of us just as it concerns you i would ask each of the panelists if you would submit in writing just a simple list to the committee of what changes would need to be made in the current tobacco program if for some reason about does not occur you know where i am on this issue made that clear from the beginning we want to buy out but if for some reason we don't get where we need to be for whatever reason it may be outside of the control of this committee it may be something that happens that we don't control over on the floor or on the other body on the other side of the hill but if we were not to get a buyout we still need to do some things to help you so if you would submit a list mr. chairman that would be permissible in writing in answer to this question of what changes could occur in the tobacco program that would help you in the event for some reason i'm out it did not occur thank you mr. chairman that request is a good one and at the end of the hearing we will ask unanimous consent to keep the record open for 10 days to allow the witnesses to respond time's up i think gentlemen recognize the gentleman from ohio mr. boehner ,are there about in the the quote that you have remained correct to follow up on the line of questioning at the chairman ask and let me go to mr. aiken i know mr. aiken and know more about his operation and even though he's a little bigger than most of us in east tennessee the situation that he outlined with respect to his farming operation is pretty typical mr. aiken is it not with respect to the cost that you incur and and the amount of net profit you get per pound. so i would ask all of you now if how many of you are still selling in tobacco auction and nobody's raising their hand all right to of course portion. pardon a portion of portion at auction but you would agree that in the way the situation is developing at auctions will soon be out of the picture do you agree to that and then we'll be left to contract selling and are all of you now selling under contract. yes sir well it doesn't make sense to you that if if the fda should get into the picture and if the fda should put regulations on the manufacturers that those are simply going to be passed through to you as producers through the contracting provision. how many years for those of you who've been contracting how many years have you been contracted but mr. carter. i had opportunity probably the contract a certain portion of my tobacco before anyone else because i grow portion of my tobacco organically and i've been under contract and that regard for six years on that portion of tobacco and that point and the

still need to produce tobacco i still want to produce tobacco but i would hope that we could get some more stability. congressman obviously most of us would anticipate if there's not a quota by all that we do experience another massive quota cut i think that my situation must be fairly similar to mr. akins just a year or two older than he is we thought we made a very conscious plan realizing that the industry was changing we've invested we thought prudently and position ourselves for the future in the industry there's no way that you can plan for 50 and 60 percent quota cuts no matter how prudent you our thank you. congressman i'm sure help will still be producing tabacco but at the last level than i am now in 1998 99 i produced 192 thousand pounds this year i'm down to 105 thousand pound i'm sure that's going to be less next year now i'm also diverse find out into a bigger cattle operation. how to will continue to raise the debacle but the problem mentioned how small we were for with the cuts we've had in the last few years i've actually picked up laces every year but yet i'm less the bog of than i was four or five years ago if i look at it scares me sometimes when i look at the land that's under my control it's over 1 000 acres and i'm raising 25 x to the bike that's how much farmland is tied up and at some of grand some of that is temple and a lot of it past you land but you guys will continue have to raise the bike if i'm going to say that. cost will continue to go up producers will have less and less net income as a result and will become less and less competitive in these global markets that we're forced to compete in these days. barney to buy quotas in southwest virginia very small to start with and this year i would say that probably 200 acres of tobacco was not put out in washington county alone just because the quotas had been shrunken so much that it wasn't profitable to go out there and put out a half acre tobacco which is about the size of a for washington county virginia the county i live in all will i be raising the back and next year next year will only tell if things continue to go the way they have the last five years we're going to be out in southwest virginia. thank you very much and mr. chairman the interest of time. i would just ask on each of the panelists given the importance of the buyout that if for some reason we did not get a buyout we're going to be left with having to deal with the current program and that concerns all of us just as it concerns you i would ask each of the panelists if you would submit in writing just a simple list to the committee of what changes would need to be made in the current tobacco program if for some reason about does not occur you know where i am on this issue we've made that clear from the beginning we want to buy out but if for some reason we don't get where we need to be for whatever reason it may be outside of the control of this committee it may be something that happens that we don't control over on the floor or on the other body on the other side of the hill but if we were not to get a buyout we still need to do some things to help you so if you would submit a list mr. chairman that would be permissible in writing in answer to this question of what changes could occur in the tobacco program that would help you in the event for some reason i'm out it did not occur thank you mr. chairman. that request is a good one and at the end of the hearing we will ask unanimous consent to keep the record open for 10 days to allow the witnesses to respond time's up. i thank you gentlemen recognize the gentleman from ohio mr. boehner,0.0,58.09999847412109,-0.2000000029802322,9.899999618530272,0.9697344039530574,0.00017938035992508394

for coming down on such short notice and also welcome everybody here in the cafeteria 120 park would also those who are on p. m. tv and watching us and as well as some people around the world who are on just an audio feed with me today are bill webb are two operating officer chuck wall or general counsel and mike semantic president/ceo of philip morris usa as bill will mention just a few minutes jeff obviously would be here but he is out of the country and bill here representing jeff each one of those three gentlemen will have a few things to say bill is going to deliver some remarks that jeff wrote because he wanted for everybody to hear what he was feeling today chuck is going to explain what has happened what the next steps are and try to give everybody a sense of why we feel pretty good about our chances are feel very good about our chances of having this thing reversed ultimately i'm on a peel and then mike is going to say a few things i'll come back real quickly at the end of that for a couple of comments and then we'll take your questions so without further ado chief operating officer philip morris companies go web thank you steve good afternoon good evening everybody jeff is in fact on his way back here he didn't leave this afternoon when he heard the verdict although one might be tempted to do that he he's on his way back he was on an overseas business trip with the longstanding commitment so he's asked me to read these comments which he had planned to give in the event that this unfortunate verdict came out as you may have guessed we are here to talk about the angle jury decision in the verdict in the amount of one hundred and forty five billion dollars against the industry and seventy four billion dollars against philip morris in a few moments i'm going to ask chuck wall to give you some details about the verdict what happens next and while we why we feel so positive about the future of this particular case but before he does i'd like to give you my perspective of where we are and it's reflective of what i said in the desk drop we issued immediately after the after the verdict came out which was about an hour or so ago it is an understatement to say that this is not a good verdict but it is not a surprise either and i can assure you that in typical philip morris fashion we prepared for every possibility that we could think of those of you who have followed this case know that the deck seem to be stacked against us from the very start rulings went against us on a remarkably consistent basis before and throughout the trial and i am certain the aim of the court was to get us to settle this case well we didn't settle and we won't settle because the law is on our side we intend and we expect to get through this and be vindicated in the end it might take a long time because of the lengthy nature of the judicial process but we will eventually get there we will launch our appeal as soon as the florida law permits chuck will explain in more detail about that in just a few moments i'm not going to pretend that the post verdict and appeal process is going to be smooth and easy i expect there will be events and court decisions that we will not be happy about but at the end of the day whenever that day comes and it will we will finally be free of this class action case and we will emerge victorious and stronger than before i can't thank you enough for sticking with us through this tortuous litigation i am sure they were mornings when some of you woke up and asked yourselves when will it ever end believe me i had plenty of those mornings myself so please continue to stick with us have confidence in our ability to work through it and focus on where we expect to come out to you and to your families whom i'm sure felt some moments of anxiety reading about the case in the newspapers i want to express my deepest appreciation for your support i'm sure it has not been easy for many of you or them i'm sure they were times when it was extremely difficult wondering what all this meant to the company especially when we were under a gag order that prevented us from speaking to you but you've made it through this difficult period with flying colors i might add given the state of our businesses and you are with us today for that i'm extremely grateful thank you each and every one of you for having confidence in us and making sure our businesses stayed humming and moving forward and now let me turn it over to chuck to explain the legal situation in more detail chuck thank you very much bill before i get into the trying to explain what i must say is a rather complicated process but i will do my very best to explain it to you let me tell you a little bit some of the things that this verdict is not the result of first of all it's not the result of the testimony of mike semantics and ellen merlot who are terrific it is they went down to the arena as i call it down there and i think dan web calls it and talked about philip morris the company today and talked about the employees of philip morris they were absolutely terrific it is not about dan web and a wonderful team he put together with his law firm of winston's tron they were absolutely spectacular and it is not about the efforts of the inhouse lawyers here particularly john mode eric and greg little who have worked so hard on this case for so long and have done an absolutely terrific job those people are to be congratulated although they don't ask for congratulations and we owe them a real debt of gratitude although they don't seek it because of the time and the effort they put in on our behalf what is verdict is in my judgement is the result of a very badly flawed process we are the victims of it and i believe the jury is the victim of it as well and as a lawyer i must say that i'm embarrassed about a system that is so flawed and a judge who i must say is been so biased this is not just a tobacco issue it is an issue that involves all of us who are interested in a judicial system that is fair and a fair process it is about every corporation who is interested in a fair and just judicial system now this may sound like somebody complaining about a very bad result in part it probably is but i think we have a great deal of justification it is actually a verdict in favor of no one as dan web and billmeyer have said today because the class members are unknown we do not know who will be participating in this verdict in the award today because they have not been identified and their cases have yet to be tried that is a process that could take many many years and there's one of the reasons i believe the process is so flawed we have said before that the certification of this class was wrong 28 out of 31 cases have been found not to be susceptible to class certification in state and federal courts in this country 28 out of 30 one decisions and the three decisions are the engel case which we are in the process of right now the burrowing case which was the etas case we settled some years ago and a case pending in louisiana in every other instance when the courts have addressed the issue of whether a class should be certified in a smoking and health case the courts have said no that is a further indication of why this is a flawed process it is a flawed process because the judge himself is a member of the class the case in the case in which he has been sitting and he refused to remove himself from the case it is a flawed process because it defies common sense and the law to have a punitive damage damage has decided in a some of this amount before a single case has been tried ,good afternoon everybody thanks for coming down on such short notice and also welcome everybody here in the cafeteria 120 park would also those who are on p. m. tv and watching us and as well as some people around the world who are on just an audio feed with me today are bill webb our cheif

beginning of take two of the best fishing doctor lilies approximately 214 question has arisen here about an exhibit that has been introduced in the barn class action and whether or not that exhibit has been introduced or i mean has been produced in washington mr. butler and i have agreed to not resolve it today and to pursue it outside the confines of the spectrum back and placed under seal conclusion that position in accordance with what may or may not be its proper designation is highly confidential until that issue is resolved in the washing the negation council and way that she won't see it we'll get it worked out outside the confines of that but thank you thank you dr. lily i just want to clear one matter up i believe that you testified earlier that at or about the time that you were involved in the art process you were of the opinion that that the delivered nicotine into the body was not a primary reason why people smoke correct yes that's correct and then when i read the sentence out of what's been marked as a little exhibit one that says that a primary people smoke is to deliver nicotine into their bodies you told me that you agreed with that sentence that and i asked you in fact whether you sit here today you agree with that sense is your opinion about the role of nicotine changed over the years objection jonathan you're going to read the sentence read it i mean please read it right okay what's it say you said a primary reason the sentence says the primary reason your opinion about the role of nicotine changed over the years i used to have a lot of discussions with bill done about the fact that i never fully accepted and by the way if you're an hour and the you can have an opinion on everything that from my personal standpoint i felt that was the reason that that i smoke cigarettes i think there's been a lot of scientific soon as of light and i certainly when i recognized what was said here even though this was written i assume in 92 or some time i would say that the majority of scientific people in the country probably would agree with the sentence number two and that's where i was coming from when you say a majority would agree with that sentence don't you think it would be actually more accurate to say the overwhelming majority agree though with that sentence injection foundation speculation and yeah i really i really don't act were you aware at or about this company at or about the time that this document was drafted anybody in the project table group expressing an opinion that that sentence the second sentence was incorrect you know i don't remember i mean i don't remember us sitting down and discussing as a body this this i mean we certainly heard a lot of discussion someone from people in the company who were not part of the group concerning everything from nicotine patches through the history of cigarettes but i really don't remember it being polled at a meeting saying to you agree with this or don't but you don't recall anyone say that that that that sentence should be taken out of the document because it's fat it's not a correct statement of believe that question at their that is not a correct statement no i never heard anyone say they would you think it's a fair characterization doctor lu to call a cigarette and nicotine delivery every system objection vague jackson calls for an opinion well i mean it certainly delivers naked thing among other things but it delivers nicotine so so it's fair to call it a get sick of tea delivery it would be a description that in my mind would be okay and nicotine of course is a drug is it not if you mean is it physiological or at least active well i think that certainly but let the what witness finish objection gets interpose before the answer what's the objection become the witness calls for an expert opinion lacks foundation i think you are being a raider of the scientific literature i would say it's certainly as mentioned act in the central nervous system and therefore is it fair to call a cigarette a drug delivery system potential drug delivery be nicotine objection form and i think you have to just be specific as to definition for this you can answer i mean personally i could see that that could be a option i could call it at our delivery system also sure i think a lot of that depends on how you want to characterize sure duck dr. lilly you are familiar with jeffrey bible of course right now yes sir you probably have heard i assume that jeffrey bible was questioned in a deposition in a case in florida a couple weeks ago yes the news yes i just want to read you one question answer that was part of that deposition and ask you whether you agree with mr. bible's answer to the question he was asked quote would phillip morris agree that a single american citizen who smoked their products for 30 years or more has ever died of disease caused in part by smoking cigarettes he answered i think there's a fair chance that one would have i'd like to know whether you agree with the statement that mr. bible gave which was in response to that question i think there's a fair chance that one would have is that something you agree with let me just are you asking him for his opinion as his personal opinion as to that underlying factual question exactly not as to fillmore's but as to dr. lily well as to dr. lily senior management and r&d and felt more sure well i'm not asking you as as the grandfather to his for sixyearolds that i can tell you so you can take that any way you want it you can answer that well i just make sure john you're not asking him whether he believes mr. bible was telling the truth or not right correct i'm not asking you to to opine on mister bibles integrity on whether that's in fact what he believes i've been asking you whether or not you agree with the response that there is a fair chance that one would have died one being an american died from smoking cigarettes that philip morris manufactured when i say died i mean in the identical let me let me let me rephrase it because as usual we've had some interference right so let's let's try to get it all right stop go off the record we get newcomer judge the judge on the phone we're back on the regular approximately 225 let me ask you as a senior manager a senior a senior manager at philip morris in their r&d department this question would you agree dr. lily that a single american citizen who has smoked the philip morris product has died in part because they were smoking cigarettes i'm going to reject a basis of lack of foundation to be on this witnesses competence i believe it calls for an expert opinion this witness is not been proffered as an expert in this case and also calls for speculation it's vague and ambiguous as well you can answer in my opinion for certainly i don't speak for philip morris and toxicology,"but we're back on the record for the beginning of take two of the industrial document

beginning on march 12th mark up this bill so that we can get it to the floor of the senate and move forward on this settlement the proposed settlement is built around a central premise in exchange for receiving certain limitations of liability the industry would agree to make payments numbering in the hundreds of billions of dollars in concede to the imposition of various and limitations on the advertising marketing and sale of tobacco products close the door back there in the garden crowd outside the lined up out the streets this morning thank you very much senator ford thank you very much senator fort the revenue stream from industry payments would be available to fund health research counter advertising campaigns smoking cessation programs and provide compensation for losses due to the use of harmful tobacco products also underpinning the settlement is the stated desire of the major tobacco companies to take a new approach to their business practices this is the idea that the proposed settlement involves a change in the culture of the tobacco companies the nation welcome such a change in the nation demands it the recent release of various internal tobacco documents makes it clear that historically tobacco companies have failed the candor test despite the industry assurances in testimony to the contrary we know now that the tobacco companies have long known that nicotine is addictive the extent to which smoking is harmful to health that there are ways to enhance nicotine kick and cigarettes and that marketing programs have been targeted at kids the tobacco companies simply must face the fact that because of your industry's history you have a significant credibility problem the american public in this committee deserve the truth inside this hearing room and now we expect it and we demand it whatever the scope of tobacco legislation our primary goal is clear and unambiguous to dramatically reduce tobacco use by children i'll consider potential tobacco legislation a failure if we're not confident it will achieve significant reductions in you smoking i also believe this committee and the american people are in agreement on this goal i look forward to a critical analysis of the many questions posed by tobacco legislation i thank the ceos for coming to this hearing i look forward to your testimony into the discussion that follows i'd like to ask members if they have brief comments senator fort thank you mr. chairman i want to thank you personally for calling this hearing this morning there's been a lot of attention in the media about the tobacco settlement and what impact the settlement might have on the public health the federal treasury and on tobacco companies one aspect of the settlement though has been neglected its impact on tobacco farmers and their communities mr. chairman there's 60 000 tobacco farmers in my state of kentucky alone and over 120 000 throughout the southeast they grow different types of tobacco in different states but they all depend on the same thing that the backup program administered by usda the tobacco program which keeps prices high and limits the supply of tobacco is paid for by the tobacco farmer and their customers many of whom are with us today a no net cost assessment is paid on each pound of tobacco to ensure that taxpayers never foot the bill for the price support program in addition to the no net cost assessment farmers also pay a budget deficit assessment that contributes about 30 million dollars to treasury each year this assessment isn't collected from any other producer just the tobacco farmer despite the fact that the program is paid for despite the fact that tobacco farmers paid to reduce the deficit and despite the fact that the president and many and public health communities now support the program and that's right mr. chairman they support the program there are senators and others who want to take this program away from the farmers who pay for it and run it mr. chairman i want to emphasize the support of the public health community for the tobacco program major public health groups are working with tobacco farmers to develop a set of core principles to govern the debate on tobacco policy this includes groups like the national center for tobaccofree kids and the american public health association principle number one reads as follows and i quote the parties agree that it tobacco production control program which supply and which sets a minimum price purchase price is in the best interest of the public health community and the tobacco producing community and surgeongeneral coop and former fda commissioner david kessler have gone on record supporting the continued operation of the tobacco program so long as it operates at no cost to the taxpayer now i'm going to be asking our witnesses a little more about the program and what it means to states like kentucky but the bottom line line mr. chairman is this ending the tobacco program means throwing tens of thousands of farmers out of work it means the end of hundreds of rural communities throughout the southeast it means spending hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayers dollars and it means providing as much as a billion dollar windfall to the tobacco companies every year many senators including you mr. chairman have agreed with me that the tobacco farmer must be taken care of in any adopted by the congress even the president in his five principles has acknowledged finally that protections for the farmer and his community must be a key part of any legislation mi ly ly fact is cosponsored by senators hollings and frisked on this committee as well as six other tobacco state senators mr. chairman i'm grateful to you that you have incorporated this farm proposal in your settlement bill that you introduced it does protect the a farmer and his community and it does so by starting with the thing that keeps those communities thriving in the first place the program that ought to be the litmus test of any farmer proposal since the june 20th agreement was announced we've seen a number of proposals to implement the settlement i think many of us on this committee would agree that these proposals are spinning out of control the latest proposal would raise tobacco taxes by a dollar and a half per pack and require the industry to pay fifteen billion dollars up front it includes penalties which include could add another dollar 74 packed and even this extreme proposal isn't the end of the road i've taken the time to total up the various proposals that have been floated to spend monies collected by the settlement the settlement assume that payments in the first five years would be fifteen nine billion dollars the present budget assumes a higher figure sixty six billion when you add up all of the other proposals health research funding child care tax cuts elementary class size reduction and many others the total of of all the ideas and congress so far on how to spend tobacco money exceeds 126 billion dollars in the first five years more than double the original settlement we need a reality check mr. chairman i believe we're at the point where we're really talking about funny money dollars that will never be there to fund all these wonderful programs why because we may just drive the companies into bankruptcy by demanding too much too fast i didn't support the latest proposal to be offered in fact i along with three other democratic colleagues wrote to the vice president urging him to begin bipartisan negotiations on a settlement we can pass i renew that call today because as i said in our letter partisan proposal simply have no chance of becoming law on this point mr. chairman i want to compliment you yours is the only bill out there that is bipartisan i appreciate that and i appreciate you're beginning a process today that i hope will lead to a strong bipartisan bill a bipartisan bill will do what's necessary to fight teen smoking we've lost the whole thrust the righteous indignation ending indignation in the beginning against tobacco has now turned into greed and it will do what's necessary to protect the tens of thousands of farmers who depend on debate on tobacco so thank you mr. chairman for your leadership and i look forward to today's testimony thank you very much senator ford center burns mr. chairman i would ask unanimous consent that my entire statement be made part of the record i will just have a couple of statements out of jackson back june 20th and 1997 when the settlement was reached between the tobacco companies and most of the state's attorney generals that accomplished some goals most of us would not have believed that could have been reached in our lifetimes it was it would substantially raise the price of cigarettes and tobacco items ,you have several more hearings and then beginning on march 12th mark up this bill so that we can get it to the floor of the senate and move forward on this settlement the proposed settlement is built around a central premise in exchange for receiving certain limitations of liability the industry would agree to make payments numbering in the hundreds of billions of dollars in concede to the imposition of various and limitations on the advertising marketing and sale of tobacco products mr. chairman we want to hear you and if you can close the door back there in the noise and crowd outside the lined up out in the streets this morning thank you very much senator ford thank you very much senator ford the revenue stream from industry payments would be available to fund health research counter advertising campaigns smoking cessation programs and provide compensation for losses due to the use of harmful tobacco products also underpinning the settlement is the stated desire of the major tobacco companies to take a new approach to their business practices this is the idea that the proposed settlement involves a change in the culture of the tobacco companies the nation welcome such a change in fact the nation demands it the recent release of various internal tobacco documents makes it clear that historically tobacco companies have failed the candor test despite the industry assurances in testimony to the contrary we know now that the tobacco companies have long known that nicotine is addictive the extent to which smoking is harmful to health that there are ways to enhance nicotine kick and cigarettes and that marketing programs have been targeted at kids the tobacco companies simply must face the fact that because of your industry's history you have a significant credibility problem the american public in this committee deserve the truth inside this hearing room and now we expect it and we demand it whatever the scope of tobacco legislation our primary goal is clear and unambiguous to dramatically reduce tobacco use by children i'll consider potential tobacco legislation a failure if we're not confident it will achieve significant reductions in you smoking i also believe this committee and the american people are in agreement on this goal i look forward to
