Nehemiah first off and if you're flying soon you may be starting to hear our work to hear which rights you have and which you don't once you're up there can flight attendants demand you put out a cigarette what if you don't can you demand to leave the plane or can you be held against your will you'll hear some surprising answers and Chef Judas at spoken shows you how to stock your kitchen like a gourmet cook and a cyst out the Clutter I'm Susan Zagora, you're watching kgo-tv serving San Francisco Oakland San Jose from the channel 7 Studio, six good morning Bay Area now here your host Susan Zecora and hammering gun Sanchez the hammer the hammer yeah they're going to go on a trip You're Gonna Fly Right and imagine your typical law-abiding American citizen you settled into your pre assigned seat you're anticipating a very pleasant cross-country flight right and you wind up being taken off the plane under arrest when you land for trying to get the smoking seat that your boarding pass said that you had this may sound like something you've seen on a television show, but it actually happened in real life and meet James tobacco who wishes it was still a television show James welcome to Good Morning Bay Area thank you let's talk about what happened to you and you got on a plane ready to fly from my believe was from Boston to Los Boston to Los Angeles after boarding the plane in the plane being late or delayed for half an hour then they were filling stand by seats and with the amount of standby people that were non-smokers last minute they decided, the to change the entire flight to non-smoking right and of course you are a smoker and I am a small guy was an ambassador section that's between first class and Coach between first class and Coach is right the captain however was not made aware that they had changed the smoking policy to non-smoking he didn't know this until a half an hour into flight time so what he had done was, turn the no-smoking light off and smokers assume that we could smoke and they had changed the know how much they had that it was now non-smoking and then the sign went on told us that it was non-smoking right before takeoff but then you said half an hour into flight time the captain turned the no-smoking white off we assume we could smoke so everyone lit up cigarettes asked to put our cigarettes out which we did, there was a lot of a lot of commotion in the coach section they're smokers in the right and so the stewardess that was in charge had gone up to the cockpit to get the captain to come back several times which he declined in doing finally we assumed at this point this is when she said well the only way to get him to come back is to say that I've been assaulted that'll get him to come back which he did she told the captain that she had been assaulted by, by you or Risinger right ahead and resulted in the know I hadn't done anything and in court the passenger Witnesses I had testified that nothing had ever taken place here point to understand where the flight attendant came by with a fire extinguisher right one of them had come by with a fire extinguisher saying that they're going to put out anyone that would light a cigarette you know did you continue to smoke through no he didn't and Ambassador section I don't know what they were doing in coach so you put your cigarette out right put it out the captain to come back, like I spoke with him and kiddingly to break you know the seriousness said where are you going to smoke because he was a smoker and he just smiled and then I said can we come up in the cockpit smoke with you and then there were which of course we could you can't do but then I had said to the captain there are for non-smokers who are willing to switch seats so that we can smoke is this possible and the captain looked at the stewardess and said, why did you take this gentleman suggestion which he did nothing about either the flight lands in Los Angeles and you or that though the stewardess is threatened to have the plane land in st. Louis which would have inconvenience me further because I was traveling with my dog and when that happens it might not have been on the same flight flight lands in Los Angeles and you're charged with obstructing the the work of a riot police were radioed ahead of time, everyone was leaving the plane very quickly there was a lot of pushing and shoving are you the only one arrested know there were three other people and we were all handcuffed taken to the police station the police officer that gave the report to the FBI the FBI declined in Prosecuting at that time and they did so four months later when I was subpoenaed what Caroline was all this happening on I don't think I'd care to mention the name of the, but Ambassador class we know is TWA but anyway joining us today is is John Charles Fox an attorney whose specialty employment law covers the area of civil rights and our travel expert Kilgore who has the facts on how some airlines are handling the potential problem we might mention to before we continue this discussion that Airline spokes people were invited to be on the program the fact and Airline well actually from another airline whose policy is no smoking on all their flights it was all set and at the last minute they declined, and to be on the program another airline was contacted to but unable to participate so kid will be explaining the policies of the airline industry obviously but let's actually start with John because you're the attorney here and you should probably tell us what legally is able to happen up there I mean once that door closes who's in charge who gets to say what happens and if you disagree what kind of a penalty is that for this well that's a good question Susan we've got a little bit of ambiguity in that Arena and particularly, this case but you're seeing evolving law yesterday for example I saw a report of a case against Delta and which a mayor up in the state of Washington was awarded his entire flight charges back in a small claims court when they refused to allow him to smoke on a flight for which he had purchased a smoking ticket we're seeing some movement in that Arena but it's not entirely clear these days what I think James case is really all about, about is how you accommodate diversity how you deal with the question of the competing interests of the smokers and non-smokers and how you keep the majority from a pressing the minority one of the key issues I think that we are facing in this Society right now hobby since R is our Inception yes obviously smokers are a minority on flights and it seems by and large so out of heard of adults in this country smoke and so by definition sure is this a civil rights issue then in a sense well I think it is in the sense that, dealing with how we tolerate different kind of peoples and cultures whether they're people who are fat or whether they are people who are less than beautiful maybe they are unattractive how do you accommodate those different kinds of people's how you keep them working side-by-side and workplace we have found many ways that we can keep smokers and non-smokers happy you just wonder not smoking is a civil right and I'll let you answer that when we come back we're going to take a break and if you have a question or comment and want to get it, on this give us a call, tomorrow good luck Innovative

and kit is our travel expert you seen him here before what actually do you understand as somebody in the travel business what do you tell your customers they can or can't do up there now since it doesn't seem that everyone's got one regulation at this, there are some varying policies on the different airlines and one of the policies that everybody's been familiar with and April 1988 any flight under two hours has been designated a non-smoking and anyway it's traveling now is made aware of that when you're buying your ticket you know that I'm not gonna be able to smoke on this flight what they've also even further down a little bit more is that if one United Airlines has said that we're going to take a little step further make it a thousand miles or less because they were finding for example if you're flying from Chicago to New York a morning flight would take an hour and 58 minutes the, inflight would take two hours and five minutes and it's going right around that border so we said we're going to make it a thousand miles in less so now everybody knows up front you can't smoke from Chicago to New York just to say let's see if you have a flight the way Jim was on the flight and let's say everybody said Jim was this was not a smoker all right there's one person can you take a boat now and what they'll do is it basically find it 80% or an 80/20 ratios of non-smokers and smokers and the of the designated smoking sections if they find a higher percentage of that where again is downward with mainland, only one person is a smoker they will actually designated a non-smoking flight and then what happens when they do that they should announce that either the time of boarding or once you're on the plane and they will say if you have disagreed with this you are allowed to get off the plane and we'll put you on the next available flight with before they pulled away from the gate not after the exactly they're all worried about on time of course when yeah and even if there's like maybe more than that we're maybe row 30 is the cutoff for the non smoking smoking section but sensors more non-smokers we're going to get back to rule 35 if you're in one of those middle Rose they'll say if there's empty seats, you the more than welcome to move back into the smoking section if you can't you still have the option to get off and catch another flight we're going to take a call right now from Mary in San Francisco good morning Mary Mary good morning first of all I think that the case this man presented he had a definite case but this whole thing is not a civil rights issue it's a health issue this person civil rights were violated and I think he should have got his his fare back on the flight at least, this whole thing about even smoking in in place is just ridiculous I mean how many square cubic feet of air is there up there and I'm nonsmoker I always have been am not a former smoker but I just think this whole thing is being blown out of proportion it's not a civil rights issue it's a health issue are so Jim I suppose the whole thing is these measures should save all the money that you had to stay on lawyers lawyers fees and go to one of those stop smoking clinics and then wouldn't have the problem but that that is that is your that is, let's talk about this because you were convicted of a felony convicted of a felony which were now appealing yeah however to just let you know that if the justice department had interviewed as many passengers as they did stewardesses that it probably would have never went to court the court went well in my favor as far as jury members later saying and making statements that I was being used as a scapegoat, that it was very far-fetched that they were making an issue of it that I wasn't you know which was well approach and then also, just the idea that it's on a federal level you know for something that to me is it's not a hijack matter it isn't you know we've got we've got a phone call I believe it's Julie she's a flight attendant yes do something obviously has to deal with this good morning Julie hello I'm a fighter and I just wanted to make the comment that when I go to work I have no choice I'm a nose nonsmoker I have no choice that I have to be subjected to other, smoke our flight attendant Union has documented cases of flight attendants getting lung cancer that have never smoked I think most most employers have to provide a smoke-free place it to work and we seem to be exempt from that and what about have you run into a situation where somebody is on a flight to let's say a no-smoking flight who wants to smoke and you've run into obvious and obvious confrontation there no I've never had that I've had people light up, supposedly not knowing they're not supposed to but they'll put the cigarette out but I just think it's a matter of health issue and that we have we have to be subjected to other people smoke and we have no choice at all most of the Employers in this country from its smoking workplace and they accommodate the competing interests of those smokers and non-smokers area here for a plane even if it's a section is still sections the same plane and I guess it comes back to the question still is smoking you know is it really a sin, all right you must this happen up there well one of the things that the courts have told us in the employment area is that environmental tobacco smoke that particulate matter does not cause medical harm to the non smoker at least if they are healthy and so one of the things we find in Plains is that there's a lot of air movement that the airline's tell us there's change it every couple of minutes I'm sorry that I have we've run out of time obviously it continues and will follow your case want to find out what happens next is that appeal thank you Jim John Gibson thank you",0.8308885548717947,0.7025605,0.9128385

Stagg do you think that there is any right for a for a smoker just to say to smoke in his own bedroom like the real question here when you're talking about US Gypsum is what are the rights of the employer and I think you're going to find very few people who will agree that an employer has a right to dictate the terms of your personal lifestyle choices to you I mean this is really kind of return to the 19th century kind of a sheriff, proper system where the employer owns you on the job and he owns you off the job and if he doesn't like what you're doing off the job on your own time when he's not paying you he'll Shake You by the shoulders until you do it his way what about their this is what about that mrs. Mueller well I think there are two misconceptions as a result here in discussing this case one is that there is no right to discriminate against anyone at all and we all know that an employer may not discriminate against anyone within the specified legal categories sex Creed Color Race gender or, or age or handicapped but within that you can discriminate as much as you like against an employee I may decide I don't want to employ footballers because they get injured when their spare time I may decide I only want to employ footballers because they're nice healthy young people and we see throughout the whole labor market constant discrimination pleasing this is where acquiesce in telling an employee that he can't smoke at home it is, own backyard and his bedroom yes I would if his conduct in smoking is going to lead to his ill health which I as an employer will have to pay for or whichever which other which other employees insurance companies if you notice they very carefully, against people who wants to get what I want to do in your own bedroom in here one thing is I'd be very willing to go down to the street now right now and if I could find a hundred people on the street in Washington with the snow the way it is I'd be very surprised if I could find one out of 100 people who would agree to the idea that an employer has a right to tell you what to do off the job I mean that's invasion of privacy I think it's pretty much an open-and-shut case but remember that's only half the invasion of privacy here the other half is that this company after the smoking ban on and off the job goes into effect is going to force its employees to submit to testing, how to determine whether or not they're smoking at home at night when they're watching The Cosby Show import impairing their job performance apparently that's the other half of this and I think that's equally outrageous when ice when the show started I didn't think I agreed with the USG action although I'm an anti-smoking I thought that was going to for every water mrs. Mueller is very convincing let's say that you're running a company and you have a bunch of nuts or or joggers they just jog constantly they jog noon and they're exhausted, they're not putting in their time their it's depriving you of a an alert employee and you said we are going to limit jogging to 10 hours a week would you be within your rights jogging off the job I think that in a number of states I'd be in big trouble with the wrongful discharge suit the idea of that is that if you fire someone for grounds that have nothing to do with their job performance off the job here's, hard time making that case and I would really just get that of time proving that a fella who smoked a cigarette in his own bedroom wood was falling down on the job however there are statistics as a matter of fact quite old ones the Dow Chemical Company way back in 1977 discovered that there were huge losses in its middle and facility melting to half a million dollars a year and among its smoking employees three to five extra days were taken in sick leave alone without any of the use of the in health insurance or anything else, so doubt upon introduce the I quit program and immediately that almost all of that half million lost was a lawyer if you move away from isolated anecdotal examples and you look at National surveys of companies that have been posed smoking restrictions and bands only three percent report actual increases in productivity is in decline in medical care costs as a result of restricting smoking so that one example side would you marry a man who smoked what if you loved him if I loved him I would, wait him to see the error of his ways but I wouldn't marry him till he stopped smoking because the question of smoking is a very important matter this is going to be someone who will be the father of my children wage earner and I don't think you should go into the most important of all contracts without a very sorry you're in love with him, illness the non-smokers I've seen a lot of stuff you can you can find studies which go behind I didn't find him I mean that there may be there are studies out there which go both ways and I haven't I haven't suggested otherwise the question here is what about smoking off the job what about drinking off the job what about bad diet off the job what about inadequate sleep off the job are any and all those things will have to be used as we say she say I want to start a company and it's a very hard work very precise Precision work as I don't want anybody who's a drinker, of Joe you could you could do it but you could certainly end up in court with wrongful discharge suits or with union labor problems because you definitely have those suits right away grievances he hasn't even heard him in point of fact you can discriminate against anyone as we said before it except these cases now the actual statistical evidence is only coming in and it's employers getting more and more interested interested and are going to suggest that she's not making a very eloquent defense of discrimination I just think discrimination in general is not the most let me move on from there, that is at least I think you mrs. Muir will say that is the most debatable question of smoke was raised but we usually hear about smokers rights from your organization the staff and from others who oppose restrictions is the idea that a smoker has a basic white smoke just about any place he wants and that if you are in the way and breathing that noxious stuff it's your tough luck isn't that your attitude that's not my attitude at all I don't think that's the attitude the industry the attitude the industry is that any, company any restaurant any group of employees union local for example that wants to restrict or ban smoking in their workplace and their place of business they can go right ahead and do that and we're not going to object to it the only thing we have checked it was legislated restrictions this is newer I'd like to know how far you'd go what happens when you sit down at a restaurant and somebody at the next table is smoking what do you do well I don't go to any restaurant that doesn't have a no-smoking section to begin with side not put in that position what would you do would you try to stop him what it what it what would happen when you, what happens when you go to a football game or a baseball game and you're the man sitting next to you is smoking a cigarette what do you do well I do too I don't go to football baseball games but as a restaurant I would move us to move to another table I would probably not approach the person if I'm sitting in a smoking section of course I would have no ground to sailing subjected smoking if she chooses you you were saying something narration which I'm came in there you said that you don't object to any of these restrictions except when the government puts, it's them in as a restriction well you know I'm not a big man for government restrictions but I don't see anything wrong with a law that says restaurants have to have smoking and non-smoking sections you know I have several times had meals ruined for me by a smoker who comes in and because I don't like to make a fuss wherever I go I try to be a very calm person I didn't make a fuss about it I just sat there don't you think that should be a law don't know we see every indication that of, half the restaurants in the country are involved in a voluntary program to restrict smoking diverse board the other half apparently don't feel that their patrons are demanding those kind of when were you last no space bomb person who but I would like to ask another thing though I was on an airplane the other day sitting in first class want to do a good deal work and they had I was in Row 4 on the left and that was not, on smoking and roll for on the right was smoking and so the whole trip was a two-hour trip I had cigarette smoke coming in front of my face well I think that's an outrage don't you how about my rights you have rights obviously and if you wanted to object to that person or suggest the airline Personnel that they should be doing about it I'm not sure what they didn't they said that's the smoking section basic point is that down here on the ground when we talked about doing something about smoking in restaurants in the workplace it usually means that we suffer get separators, Brigade smokers and we've done that in the air since 1971 how about just not permitting any smoking because it fills up the point what's wrong with that can't can't somebody not smoke for two hours three hours four hours there's absolutely no indication for the flying public that that's desired really think I personally would be delighted to receive from mr. Novak has written a complaint and I would be happy to file it with the Department of Transportation under the present law to the present regulations a nonsmoker has a right to introduce it to the non-smoking seat and he should not be unreasonably burden by drift, in tobacco smoke and I think that there has been a breach of the regulations in your place and boom we have no corporate hello we are completed 100 voluntary organizations have to take a break and when we get back I'm going to try to find out from the tobacco lobbyist if it isn't a fact that maybe we'd all be better off if years ago they didn't discover that this little leaf, pause backhoe and tobacco smoking welcome back to Crossfire does the smoker really have any rights should he have any rice we're talking about that with Athena Mueller of action on smoking and health and anti-smoking, poking organization and Scott staff of the tobacco Institute of pro smoking organization is pose you want people to smoke for more people to smoke don't we represent the tobacco industry we don't actually sell cigarettes we represent their views and concerns in Washington and state capital cities around then where are you opposed to a ban on advertising on smoking if you don't want more and more people to smoke I think precisely the same reason that most civil Libertarians including the ACLU the American civil liberties Union and other groups are opposed to it it's a blatant violation of the First Amendment and the idea of free speech in general it, not make any sense that as long as a product is legal that it should be illegal to advertise his realtor you've been your against smoking again I would like to know how far you'd go what is your does your organization proposed to ban cigarettes on airplanes also talked about to ban smoking yeah yeah points we would have preferred initially to have smoke free flights so that smokers and non-smokers could choose but and we try to attempt this through corporate action you bet would you we would as we, we as that was not successful we would ban where we would except okay would you ban all cigarette advertising in newspapers and magazines we would much prefer to have equal time and space we would like to have every magazine that accepts the cigarette ad to also put in a health help add in the same Scene Magazine and we would much rather have the full statement in SQL statement but because they will not do this we would accept would you just one more would you propose the to double the tax on cigarettes, as a way of discouraging the young yes we would think that is very important because to cigarette smoking is definitely decreased as the price goes up first of all I think this is pretty obviously an outline for piecemeal prohibition censorship economic prohibition by trying to price the product out of the market through manipulation of the tax code On and On Right Down the Line it's restricting the use it's essentially piecemeal prohibition the tax on cigarettes is already at the highest level of any consumer product in American society when someone goes always packs of cigarettes you never any Nation, world and while I guess you can only compare to u.s. Parks you compare it to any other products and welcome how can you call that mr. freely how can you put a piecemeal prohibition I mean when I was a smoker if I if I needed it one of those little sick he's in the middle of the night I wouldn't care if it was $10 a pack I'd run out and get them people who are addicted to Tobacco it doesn't matter what the prices are just like not according to any stalking groups anti-smoking groups claim that the reason that tax increase my sentence reduced, hoping you call that prohibition when a real surreal smoker isn't going to be deterred no it's if you think about it it's piecemeal prohibition I refer to it that way because it's an attempt to manipulate the tax code to price a legal product out of the market to put it beyond the reach of consumers that's exactly what they don't think you believe it but let me let me go on to something you know we're talking about second-hand smoking whether when I'm on an aeroplane when I'm in a restaurant I work in a small office nobody smokes in the office of everybody smoking at all, it'll be very unpleasant but is it just a matter of unpleasant isn't it true that the second hand smoke is very damaging to the health of the nonsmoker you mentioned offices in public places the National Academy of Sciences released a report in November the was it was commissioned by Congress to do the study it released a report in November which said that there's no scientific proof that occasional exposure to tobacco smoke in public places like restaurants and the private workplace occasional occasional means the type of exposure you run into when you go into a restaurant every day, I'm troubled every day and that's what you're on a plane on Monday you were in a restaurant on Tuesday you're in some place else on Wednesday in an office with coin of the National Academy of Sciences that kind of occasional exposure does not present a risk to this is more recent study by mr. James replaced which has been also approved by the Surgeon General and been taken into account at least between five hundred and five thousand percent, I just found that this to be true the National Institute of Health says that environmental smoke damage is negligible the World Health Organization that the UN says there is no demonstrated health hazard and consumer report shows the same Federal Officer technology yes yes that's a lie and in addition to this tobacco smoke contains many carcinogens many toxic world but what do you say to the what do you say in answer to the preamble to the eminent scientific organizations I just cited, nearly because this is a cumulative effect as mr. Novak said when you're getting it 24 hours a day of sniff here in the snifter you soon have a cumulative effect on the federal government has decided that there is no minimum acceptable dose for a cost in the general General so there's a 30% greater chance of cancer that was the surgeon general's conclusion but the National Academy of Sciences released a report the month earlier that reached opposite conclusions on key points the only places were laws are going to be passed it seems to me are not in people's bedrooms not in people's backyards but in the nest, private workplace and in restaurants and other public places National Academy of Sciences also said that it was highly desirable that smoking Aloft and airplane should be completely banned chemistry just to get your credentials and credentials of the tobacco Institute you don't even really yet after all these years of reports accept the fact that smoking I'm not talking about secondhand smoke I mean taking that stuff and dragging on it that you don't even think that hurts you doing I don't like cigarettes have ever been advertised as being helpful, but you got to - do you are you are you and I think we're going to make Munoz will you say that it's damaging your health what we have said all along and I think is sustained by a number of different scientists and researchers is that you know it's obvious when you read the reports going back to the 1964 surgeon general's report the first one that was issued 17 reports ago that there is a statistical correlation between cigarette smoking and a number of different diseases including lung cancer the only question really remaining in the scientific Community is what the precise nature of that relationship is what exactly it means and that's that's, it's what we've said for a number of years and there are a number of people we can produce you still I just can't believe you're still staying there but mr. Stephen can we really say that that this is really a filthy habit with no particular good in within the whole world would really be better off if Sir Walter Raleigh or wherever he was hadn't figured out if you bring the tobacco there he's already been sung Bob so I don't know I think that I think that's up to the 60 million adult Americans decide for themselves, who's ever come out of this having on the economy would be a lot poor I mean you're talking about 2.1 million jobs you're talking about fifteen billion dollars in tax collection way we are talking about legal products this is really your strike me as a kindly kindly person intelligent person a person who's willing to exercise courtesy do you I want to get you back to this company rule here's a company that says to his workers, in nine points across the United States you may not smoke in your own bedroom and we will test you with a lung test you come in and breathe and we'll see if your breath is good to do you would you do that to would you do that to anybody you're actually helping these people your yeah but you may be helping him but you are interfering in their private lives you're going into their household you're forcing him to take tests afterwards to see if he cheated you wouldn't do that we we we are we are, is not anti smoker we're just anti-smoking and we have smokers in our membership but we do believe in this particular instance a smoker has a privilege not a right to smoke he has a privilege to smell and if he is not taking money out of my pocket this is no smoke or have any rights new I think someone has a privilege to smoke, there's with myself you the right to interfere with the right are we've got an American businessman to run his business Tom since your heart is bleeding so much for all those smokers may be a calm your nerves a little would you like a dry it would, I can say hey I just started I just wanted to go ahead smoke you know I smoked two or three a day sometimes it's sometimes many of these a smoke by 2 or 3 packs that you don't you think and I still feel guilty but let me put it to you this way it's the Republican convention you are invited to help select the candidate but the room is a smoke-filled room do you enter it I don't enter at all because I really have so much regard for my body I wouldn't subject myself to this, and I think you'd be in better shape today calm if you felt the same way from the left I'm Tom Brady the way I'm Robert Novak join us again next time for another edition of Crossfire, if you would like to comment on tonight's program right to CNN Crossfire 111 Massachusetts Avenue Northwest Washington d.c. to 0001",0.8170812588372093,0.7043655,0.9128392

Also includes a compilation of TV News reports and interviews about this lawsuit.","tobacco, cigarette, legal activity, lawsuit, lawyer, television,  industry response, media campaign, tobacco manufacturer, tobacco farmer, secondhand smoke, cancer, research activity, government agency",tobacco_ixb77c00,"on January 7 1993 the United States Environmental Protection Agency issued its final risk assessment on environmental tobacco smoke declaring it a group a carcinogen there have been many valid criticisms of that EPA action and that particular risk assessment is among the most flawed ever issued by the Environmental Protection Agency,today the council for Burley tobacco the flue-cured tobacco Cooperative stabilization Corporation gal Vending Company Universal leaf tobacco company RJ Reynolds tobacco company and Philip Morris have filed suit in United States district court for the Middle District of North Carolina to have that EPA risk assessment declared null and void in essence this lawsuit consists of three basic charges,first epa's preparation and publication of the ETS risk assessment violated the terms and limitations of federal law in other words EPA exceeded its statutory Authority s EPA failed to follow its own publicly announced guidelines for conducting cancer risk assessments very simply when the guidelines would not allow for the epa's preconceived and predetermined conclusion,the guidelines were ignored third we believe that throughout the EPA risk assessment process the agency made numerous mistakes and those mistakes were compounded by a series of data manipulations that violate established principles of science as well as what should be established principles of government I wish I could tell you that what the EPA has done about environmental tobacco smoke is unprecedented, prevented that it is just an aberration aimed at an unpopular Target but it's not the epa's history regarding dioxin Al are and other substances clearly indicates otherwise, tobacco is unpopular and the science of environmental tobacco smoke is complex but in the courtroom soundbites don't count and evidence must exceed the parameters of public opinion that's why we seek judicial review of the EPA action and its treatment of environmental tobacco smoke, plain and simple we believe they have overstepped their Authority and rendered a decision that is unjustifiable and unsupportable, do I ask the Growers across the country the EPA decision goes far beyond being capricious and arbitrary and affect the EPA decision was he decision to in fact destroy the livelihood of hundreds of thousands of US citizens who are tobacco Growers and those who get their business from providing tobacco Growers goods and services, so I can't adequately tell you how it feels to see your future in the hands of a government agency that has a history of questionable decisions and policies an agency that has been held by numerous courts to have violated its own governing law an agency known for predetermining policy decisions and matching scientific studies to support them, from ABC this is World News Tonight with Peter Jennings the tobacco industry has gone to court as ABC's Bettina Gregory reports a coalition of tobacco farmers and cigarette makers claim that the EPA report is based on faulty science and should be ignored today the tobacco industry fought back it's sued the EPA claiming the government ignored scientific evidence and manipulated data to conclude environmental tobacco smoke know, it's ETS causes cancer for this substance the science does not support the claim that environmental tobacco smoke is harmful to non-smokers the industry claims the EPA did not consider two major 1992 studies which showed non-smoking spouses of smokers did not increase their risk of lung cancer nevertheless the tobacco industry claims the epa's position on secondhand smoke is based on politics not science this is NBC Nightly News the, in Ewing smoking Wars some of the Giants of the tobacco industry in this country fired back today suing the Environmental Protection Agency in federal court at issue once again secondhand smoke today the tobacco industry fought back Philip Morris RJ Reynolds and others announced a suit against EPA containing the finding known carcinogen is not supported by scientific evidence that particular risk assessment is among the most flawed ever issued by the Environmental Protection Agency this is the CBS, evening you with Dan Rather and Connie Chung good evening the tobacco industry and the federal government are locking horns over secondhand smoke the tobacco industry today filed a federal lawsuit attacking the Environmental Protection agency's ruling it secondhand tobacco smoke can cause cancer claiming it was based on faulty scientific evidence there have been many valid criticisms of that EPA action and that, ticular risk assessment is among the most flawed ever issued by the Environmental Protection Agency the EPA decision was a decision to in fact destroy the livelihood of hundreds of thousands of US citizens who are tobacco Growers and those who get their business from providing tobacco Growers goods and services this is CNN live from the world's Financial Capital New York City this is money line, with Lou Dobbs good evening for years the tobacco industry has successfully defended itself against lawsuits for health and liability claims today the tobacco industry went on the offensive for the first time ever taking the Environmental Protection Agency to court it's high stakes combat filing their civil suit and US District Court in Greensboro North Carolina lawyers for RJ Reynolds and Philip Morris they were joined by tobacco Growers and of, vending machine company they want the court to throw out the epa's finding that secondhand smoke is a known cause of cancer if they applied the same rules that apply to environmental tobacco smoke to chlorinated drinking water but you and I and our children drink every day they would have concluded that chlorinated drinking water is a class a carcinogen the tobacco industry suit repeats previous arguments that the EPA exceeded its Congressional Authority and used faulty science but tobacco industry, the EPA ignored studies that didn't support predetermined conclusions does secondhand smoke put non-smokers at a greater risk for cancer a coalition of tobacco Growers and cigarette maker says no it is suing the federal government to have an Environmental Protection Agency report on passive smoke declared null and void the suit filed in federal court in North Carolina charges the EPA used faulty science to conclude secondhand smoke can cause cancer Irv Chapman reports previous lawsuits against, the EPA are giving the tobacco industry hope, asbestos banned from most uses because of its link with cancer but still found in a few products like brake linings that's because a court overruled EPA when manufacturers got a panel of experts to compare the comparatively slight risk from asbestos with a much greater risk of Highway death from cars with inferior breaks for 12 years EPA and forced an expensive hazardous waste mixture disposal requirement on oil electric and chemical companies till the companies joined in a lawsuit, appeals court ruled EPA failed to take into account the compliance problems it caused the affected industry still industry lawyers agree and as the tobacco industry well knows EPA does not win them all and in any court case there's more than one route to Victory judges have occasionally ruled that EPA regulated with too much haste and sent the agency back to the drawing board so by starting a lawsuit some Industries have won their point by getting EPA to negotiate a regulatory compromise before the court has ruled, this is the if they take tobacco away from us I guess I'll do like the rest of the state I'll go on welfare tobacco Farmers dogged by unkind reports about their crops fight back to save their livelihood and their future good evening one of America's most powerful lobbies the Tobacco industry's on the offensive tonight it's taking the government to court my black has been raising tobacco in Union Kentucky for 40 years now it's fed his family, and is this sign shows he's proud of it you know it's just a way of life and way of life has been increasingly in question since the federal government ruled second hand cigarette smoke causes cancer today the tobacco industry sue the Environmental Protection Agency claiming its ruling was based on bad science there have been many valid criticisms of that EPA action and that particular risk assessment is among the most flawed ever issued by the Environmental Protection Agency with cigarette smoking increasingly being banned in public places that, backhoe industry says the EPA ruling threatens the livelihoods of tobacco Growers and people in related industries that brings us back to Bob flag of Union Kentucky flag says fifty percent of his income comes from tobacco his farm is on hilly land not good for other cash crops and is too small to support livestock so the lawsuit filed by the tobacco industry May determine Flags financial future it is says flag politics pure and simple wish to Hell they'd leave us all alone and let us do what we want to do, that is somebody telling us what we can't do today tobacco companies fired back against the Environmental Protection Agency by filing the lawsuit the company's claim EPA research that shows secondhand smoke has a high risk of causing cancer is flawed smokers we talked to today say they're glad someone is sticking up for their rights we were just starting to stress too much out on smoking you know but you got to look at if everybody quit smoking cigarettes every 100,000 people unemployed in the state, sure nobody wants that today the tobacco industry is apparently striking back and health reporter Kathryn Berry joins us tonight Katherine the industry is going to court over this aren't they to Tobacco Giants and arch-rivals have joined forces and gone on the offensive they filed suit today against the Environmental Protection Agency they want the EPA to withdraw its conclusion on secondhand smoke the suit claims the EPA was biased in its use of scientific findings rewrote the rules for evaluating those findings to get the, Jeanette wanted and doesn't have the authority to regulate indoor air quality just to study it is this time it's the tobacco companies doing the suing they want the Environmental Protection Agency to withdraw its findings on the dangers of second-hand smoke, we have pointed before to the fact that when the EPA could not otherwise reach its predetermined conclusion using generally accepted scientific and statistical practices the EPA simply change the rules but the EPA has been slapped with a lawsuit filed by six tobacco companies claiming the EPA misused scientific data about secondhand smoke and want the report to be declared invalid the EPA simply changed the rules, that fact alone can and should negate the EPA conclusions well now that the backhoe industry is fighting back suing the EPA to get that classification thrown out the tobacco industry claims the EPA used faulty procedures and manipulated data to come up with those results but the public be aware through this judicial process that this shoddy science ought not to be allowed to serve as the primary basis for total non smoking bans tobacco industry is taking on the federal government, over its findings about the dangers of secondhand smoke RJ Reynolds and Philip Morris are suing the Environmental Protection Agency challenging its claim that secondhand smoke causes cancer the companies charge the EPA misused scientific data to reach this conclusion of layered for a governmental agency to leave out studies to change the rules in the middle of the game in order to justify a scientific claim in my judgment is totally improper a lawsuit filed today by 6, backhoe company's claims the epa's findings are flawed the suit claims the agency used faulty science and improper procedure to reach its conclusion that tobacco companies say the EPA made a judgment based on politics not science some popular and the science of environmental tobacco smoke is complex but in this courtroom soundbites don't count and evidence must exceed the parameters of public opinion that's why, we seek judicial review of the EPA action and its treatment of environmental tobacco smoke the nation's top tobacco companies are suing the federal government challenging the findings of a recent report on secondhand smoke RJ Reynolds Philip Morris and several other large tobacco producers are charging the Environmental Protection Agency used poor scientific data when it ruled that secondhand smoke can cause cancer in non-smokers EPA science is frequently a, ask to fit policy and I would submit to you that we are a case study in EPA science being adjusted to fit policy RJ Reynolds and Philip Morris and filed a huge lawsuit against the Environmental Protection Agency claiming the report was based on faulty scientific evidence backhoe growers in a vending machine company also joined the suit the EPA decision was a decision to in fact destroy the livelihood of hundreds of thousands of US citizens who are tobacco Growers, us and those who get their business from providing tobacco Growers goods and services it's a case of the government versus Big Business the tobacco industry several of the nation's tobacco Giants are suing the EPA over its finding that second hand cigarette smoke can cause cancer the company's claim the EPA misused scientific data and that it ignored other studies that say the risks from second hand cigarette smoke are minimal we think that this can be dealt with with some common sense some courtesy and work, appropriate separation of smokers and non-smokers in restaurants for example in in in the workplace smoking lounges or whatever but for a governmental agency to leave out studies to change the rules in the middle of the game in order to justify a scientific claim in my judgment is totally in problem well today the tobacco industry is striking back RJ Reynolds Philip Morris and other interest groups have filed suit against the Environmental Protection Agency questioning the methods used to find that secondhand smoke causes, has cancer the Coalition of Industry Giants is squaring off in what some people are calling a battle of the scientists they accuse the EPA of using simply bad science for the industry say that they would not have filed the suit if they didn't think they could win it they're trying to get the EPA to withdraw its conclusions tonight the tobacco industry is striking back at the nation's Environmental Protection Agency for ruling that secondhand smoke causes cancer in people who don't smoke cigarette makers say the ruling hurt business, and today took the EPA to court the industry claims the EPA rewrote scientific rules to reach the conclusion that secondhand smoke is a lethal carcinogen, tobacco companies including RJ r-- Reynolds and Philip Morris or ticking the EPA to court they see the agency's findings and environmental tobacco smoke or so-called second hand smoke should be declared null and void a lawsuit filed in a federal court claims the EPA has no authority to regulate indoor air quality only to study it a spokesman for Philip Morris as the head of the EPA was out of bounds and executing the study to conclude secondhand smoke causes cancer he intended for this document, be viewed by the American public as the last word from the federal government on this subject that's not what EPA was asked to do by Congress and they didn't go about doing it in the right way and we hope that the court will require that EPA stay within its Authority the backhoe industry and the Environmental Protection Agency are once again at odds over the effects of second-hand smoke attorneys representing several tobacco interest filed suit today in federal court challenging the epa's testing methods and conclusion on secondhand smoke, with the ongoing battle is the subject of tonight's talk back joining us live from Washington is Steve Parrish who is a senior vice president for Philip Morris mr. Parrish thanks for joining us do you think this lawsuit filed today which it affect takes on the federal government has any chance at all absolutely if we didn't think we had a good case we wouldn't have filed our lawsuit EPA has ignored its own guidelines refused to apply them when they didn't suit their predetermined course of action they've ignored studies they've manipulated the data, a and as a last resort we felt like we had to take them to court what kind of financial impact could it have on the tobacco industry I think one reason you see such a broad consensus in the tobacco family come into court today included Burly Growers flue-cured Growers cigarette manufacturers Leaf buying companies as well as a retail Vending Company all realize that when unsound shoddy science is used to make claims against, our product that we all suffer we all suffer financially and our customers and non-smokers alike are all entitled to know what the truth is that's why we filed this lawsuit today the tobacco industry is blasting the EPA and it's filed suit in federal court challenging the agencies claims that passive smoking is deadly it can certainly jeopardize a livelihood of 500,000 tobacco Growers across this country well the tobacco industry says the EPA used, conclusions to reach that point and today they filed this suit in federal court in Greensboro the spokesman says the report has hurt tobacco sales and has caused many public buildings to ban or to restrict smoking seeking money damages are we simply want to do is have the court declare that the EPA acted outside of the statutory Authority and when it acted as it did it acted arbitrarily and capriciously and its report should be set aside Philip Morris Vice President Steve Parrish joins us live from Washington d.c. to, help us sit through all the claims first of all mr. Parrish thanks for being with us thanks for having me our tobacco companies trying to say now that secondhand smoke does not cause cancer but we said today in federal court in North Carolina was what the EPA did was wrong that the scientific data the scientific evidence is not there to support the claim that EPA made specifically EPA ignored its own guidelines when it didn't suit their purposes to follow the guidelines EPA omitted studies it, it manipulated the data and we believe this is not right it's not right scientifically it's not right legally it's not the first time that EPA has been criticized for doing something like this and we felt like we owed it to our employees our consumers and to non-smokers to take this course of action so that we could right the wrong that EPA has tried to do well I'll explain if you will of layman's terms the evidence your scientists have regarding secondhand smoke well the interesting thing, thing that we're faced with on the second hand smoke issue is that at least in theory we're all looking at the same body of evidence unfortunately EPA decided to Omit from their consideration in their final document certain studies which didn't support their ultimate conclusion our Point has been that all the evidence ought to be can included in the assessment and if that's done you can't support the claim that ETS is harmful to non-smokers, our lawsuit is about what the EPA has done wrong and what the EPA has done wrong is it's acted wrong on two counts on the law and on the science and Monica on the law the EPA expressly contradicted and went against the authority that Congress granted it the EPA violated its own risk assessment guidelines and I understand by the way the dr. Littman said that if we did not comply with the guidelines well then let's change the guidelines and EPA is also wrong on the, science and badly wrong and I'd like to offer a few examples of that for you for example EPA ignored two studies that were available to it prior to the issuance of this report when if EPA had considered these two United States studies and included them in its analysis the entire conclusion on which its risk estimate is based would not have come out the same way they would have ended up with a statistically nonsignificant result secondly of the 11 USC, studies that the EPA did rely upon in addressing these issues not one of them not one as originally reported produced a statistically significant estimate of risk that is until the EPA manipulated and massage the data finally what the EPA did here in the course of this risk assessment was change the rules it adopted different standards different tests and different methodologies all of which it has rejected in other contexts and found them acceptable here, and I would put to dr. Lipman these questions because I think they do need answering and they need to be addressed by the EPA that I think it is clear that the EPA did not include in its meta-analysis the two US studies that were available to it and that had it done so it's risk estimate would not have been of a statistically significant increased risk there would not have been the statement that ETS could be considered a group a carcinogen, and I think it it has been an abuse of trust by the EPA to raise this fear in the American public without telling them that the conclusion would have been different had they kept the Books open for another few months to get the most recent studies in mr. Weber let me just ask you this because I'm running out of time any chance this might be settled out of court what would it take I think Matt would be the best way for this to be settled and I think administrator Browner could do a great service for the country and by admitting the fact that this report was rushed out without, the data by former administrator Riley because his tenure was about to end I think she could restore credibility to the agency by saying I'm going to withdraw this and we're going to look at it again and we're going to do it in a fair and objective way on a basis in which the rules are applied evenly for everyone even tobacco companies are mr. Donohue good morning good morning Granny you're sooo charges of the EPA misuse science overstepped his authority you've been quoted as saying there's much more politics to this than just bad science what politics we, talking about well I don't know what the motivation of the EPA is I can tell you what they did I can tell you that prior to the time the EPA conducted its risk assessment assessment it issued a workplace guideline manual which provided assistance to and advice to people in the workplace as to how to deal with a problem prior to the time they had even conducted the risk assessment to decide whether or not they're in fact was a problem and of course during the course of the risk assessment as our lawsuit points out, PA for whatever motivation decided that they would simply change the rules as those rules apply to previous risk assessments, what I thought we would do today is yesterday after we filed the lawsuit we had a press conference in Washington and I thought I would read to you the statement that I gave to the press as well as the statement that Fred Bond made to the Press on behalf of all the tobacco Growers that both the birla group and the flue-cured group represent then after that I thought I'd tell you a little bit about some of the coverage and some of the things that have gone on since we filed the lawsuit some of the, action that we have received talk to you a little bit about how the lawsuit will progress how we can expect that to happen and then we should have plenty of time if anybody has questions about this or anything else",0.8582560781818181,0.70710355,0.9128387

Kessler is saying is he wants to work with the, Congress legislation giving the FDA jurisdiction is bitterly opposed by the tobacco Lobby and if the commissioner were to act on his own litigation is always a possibility and the industry has prevailed in court on the drug question in the past while no one is talking about an outright ban there is considerable interest in reducing the level of nicotine in cigarettes but the industry says that amounts to Prohibition yet for all the smoke many Financial analysts are bullish on Tobacco domestically and abroad, it's four billion dollars to our trade balance I think would be political suicide to do something like make it harder for us to export our cigarettes the FDA does have new ammunition in its war against tobacco but it's going to take a lot of Firepower to bring cigarettes under regulatory control Jeff Levine CNN Washington",0.8658740716666667,0.77281445,0.9128389

reports of Industry content, ins that there are grounds on which nicotine is good for you do you know anything about those arguments what they are well Bob scientists and doctors have known for a long time the nicotine is really an interesting molecule it's been studied possibly as a treatment for Parkinson's Disease as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease and recently doctors have even looked at this as a possible approach to treating schizophrenia nicotine works on the brain that's the theory anyway the question is is it also addictive now the government says nicotine is an addictive, a drug the industry says it isn't at least as the way it's used in cigarettes that's going to be the focus of these long-term arguments anyway nicotine is a very intriguing molecule used in a number of different ways possibly for good or otherwise but third of course is huge financial involvement in the court for a cuss you are going to be covering today Jeff the advertising industry for one stands to gain or lose from the outcome to they have a say in at any level well they're part of the proceedings, they're arguing against the government they're asking the judge here for summary judgment other words they want to stop these regulation from going into effect it's estimated that the tobacco industry spends some six billion dollars a year in the u.s. promoting its product obviously if those advertising efforts were curtailed to some degree that would have an effect on the advertising industry as well so there are a lot of folks that are tied into this litigation it's a very very big series of lawsuits with lots of ramifications and it will probably go on for years and years and years all right, Jeff Levine in Greensboro North Carolina we're not through with this story despite all the Shades of Gray there may be in between there are two clear clearly DeMark sides to the issue will hear from them both with guests alive debates after this we have been focusing this morning on a Clash deep in the heart of tobacco country joining us now to discuss whether the government should as it plans to regulate cigarette advertising Matthew Myers, in Greensboro North Carolina he's head of the national Center for tobacco free kids and with us from Washington Congressman Edward Whitfield The Congress me represents the morning Congressman good morning results the first district of Kentucky and serves on the house Commerce Committee and thank you both for joining us mr. Myers let me turn to you first you have been described I think describe yourself as a civil libertarian yet here you are in favor of these regulations which the industry says restricts a basic civil liberty of theirs, I'm very much a civil libertarian you know it's illegal to sell cigarettes to kids if it's illegal to sell cigarettes kids it's obviously illegal to advertise to them eighty-six percent of all children in this country smoke the three most heavily advertised Brands last year alone the tobacco industry spent over five billion dollars marketing their products much of it in forms of advertising that appeal to kids this regulation is not about restricting advertising to adult it is very much limited to limiting those forms of advertising, thin courage kids to smoke the government clearly has that right it ought to do that how do you restrict advertising to kids without restricting all advertising they're going to see it no matter where it is aren't they one of the things that the government has carefully done in this case is it's only a limited those forms of advertising have the greatest appeal to kids it will eliminate Joe Camel in the Marlboro Cowboy but only in those movies newspapers and magazines that a lot of kids read it will eliminate brand name sport sponsorship so that the Marlboro, I'll race team no longer is the role model for kids Philip Morris can still sponsor racing events but just not under the Marlboro Name by doing this it eliminate the images to make tobacco products appealing to kids to make tobacco products cool for kids okay help to create that peer pressure all right the kids feel Congressman What fields that sound fair to you know it does not bother as matter of fact the real issue here is that FDA does not have the legal authority to Institute these regulations since, 14 FDA has agreed with the Congress that they do not legally have the power to do this and that's the real issue here this is an issue for the Congress to decide and this issue should not be unilaterally determined by the FDA 50 states already prohibit the sale of tobacco products to minors 13 agencies of the government already regulate tobacco and in the countries where they have banned tobacco advertising such as in Sweden and, Norway tobacco use has increased so this is a violation of commercial free speech and I think the courts will rule these regulations illegal Congress would you say 50 states already have laws against selling tobacco to minors what do you say to the fact that 33 of those States 2/3 of them support these proposed new rules well I think that's fine and I think they should come to Congress and let Congress do this act even FDA in their legal briefs in the past have indicated, and have said that they do not have the legal authority to regulate this product and they don't have that Authority because Congress has specifically said they do not have the authority mr. Meyers great there's a great irony in the congressman's argument for 30 years the tobacco industry hid what it was doing and what it knew about nicotine new evidence now demonstrates conclusively the tobacco manufacturers deliberately adjust the manufacturing process to deliver nicotine, in to promote addiction it is precisely the definition of a drug that falls under the fda's authority in many respects the argument that Congress failed to act before should preclude them now is like saying that the demand be hoarded Thomas Congress should not be precluded you can bring power you can bring pressure on the Congress and the Congress is the proper agency to take these steps not included yay the Food and Drug Administration has authority over all products we, ingest that affect the structure and fund a have never had authority over tobacco they never been given they've never been given specific authority over any drug they happen now well I may have said everything just if you just let me finish Congressman then I'd be happy to have you enter in what has happened now is that new evidence from inside the tobacco industry has shown that the tobacco manufacturers deliberately control levels of nicotine because of its addictive impact on consumers that's the precisely the same definition that's applied to all other, all were saying for tobacco is level the playing field treated as all of their products through just to protect our kids mr. Myers and give the congressman a chance to answer because we're running short of time gonna let me say this to you first of all the Center for Disease Control and the National Institute on health abuse and other surveys have indicated that the percentage of young people using tobacco has decreased significantly over the last 30 years on second of all second of all second of all let me finish mr. Lee finished, second of all the use of marijuana and cocaine has increased dramatically and as I've said before the issue here is who has the legal authority to do this the US Congress is the proper agency to do it you need to bring your pressure and your lobbyists to the Congress and convince the Congress to do it because FDA has never had the legal authority to regulate this product gentlemen I have to jump in we're fresh out of time and I thank you both very much for joining us, this morning we will of course begin to get answers to some of these questions as determined by the courts beginning today",0.8365289213043478,0.7741456,0.9128387

activity",tobacco_bzq91f00,"turkey,yeah yeah,can you,the letter that Surgeon General wrote that apparently showed a difference between both statements privacy settings what does that really show what shows very clearly that what's happening is that there's a willingness on the part of the Surgeon General other people in his office other Federal officials to abuse the scientific literature on cigarette smoke in the air in the health of non-smokers to say one thing publicly in order to scare non-smokers and to try to scare lawmakers into restricting smoking,but privately to other scientific colleagues to acknowledge that it's not a settled issue and that there is room for the settings scientific view points that's very disturbing obviously there's that letter I guess that led a raises a lot of questions what a race is a lot of questions I guess the first question is how far is the Surgeon General willing to go to suborn politics excuse me to suborn science to his political agenda it's clear so far that he's been willing to say almost anything and do almost anything if he thinks the effect will be to get non-smokers and to get lawmakers in, neural to restrict or ban smoking problem is that he knows that the scientific literature doesn't support that in fact in his private correspondence he admits that much now in terms of the concerned about century scientist what is what is the major concern for that second I'm sure, how are they attempted what you found or what they've tried to do spend specific instance is to shut down scientific discussion of this issue of cigarette smoke near in the health of non-smokers what that's meant specifically is that you've got Federal officials who are stepping into a situation and trying to prevent the free and open exchange of ideas in an academic setting I think if that was any other issue other than tobacco you have a lot of people up in arms the fact that it's tobacco me and some people are going to say well maybe, maybe this is something that we can get away with doing but I don't think it is I think it raises general questions about academic freedom scientific integrity and very serious questions and so far we don't have any good answers on why anyone in the federal government would allow this to happen what kind of reaction do you think soup is going to have his letter has it been in your academic bar well here's a basic approach to Tobacco particular in the question of cigarette smoke in the air and the health of non-smokers is that he can play tennis with the Nets down doesn't have to be objective scientifically doesn't have to acknowledge that there's descending viewpoints you can do anything you, to do say anything he wants to say so I'm sure he's going to attempt to dismiss this out of hand that's why we took the unusual and unprecedented step of requesting a formal investigation by the Department of Health and Human Services rather than just simply raising the issue is a concern, like to just briefly get introductions out of the way first so you know who we are my name is Scott staff the last name is stapf I'm assistant to the president of the tobacco Institute which is the trade Association in Washington for u.s. cigarette manufacturers with me is John Rabe last name is our Upp he is an attorney with Covington & Burling here in Washington Washington and expert on academic freedom and censorship issues like to start now given the lateness of the, our we are here today to make public the fact that the tobacco Institute has taken the unprecedented in our view very serious step of requesting a formal investigation by the Department of Health and Human Services into the conduct of federal officials who have been involved in efforts to violate academic freedom and systematically abused and distort science for the sake of their political agenda and this case specifically the agenda of a smoke-free Society by the year 2000 this is involved the undertaking of steps by foot, oh officials to censor dissenting scientific view points and to twist and bend science in an effort to manufacture evidence to increase the likelihood of passage of legislated smoking restrictions which they have acknowledged upfront is the key to their announced political goal of a smoke-free Society by the year 2000, we also today are releasing a report tobacco smoke in the non-smokers scientific integrity at the crossroads which document specific cases of censorship intimidation and the sacrificing of science to politics the underlying issue here to be very simple about it is environmental tobacco smoke other people smoke and the health of non-smokers the recent report on environmental tobacco smoke by the National Academy of Sciences actually the national research council's panel on that issue acknowledged that it was not possible on scientific runs, extrapolate research about environmental tobacco smoke health effects in the home to the workplace and public places such as restaurants but without this leap from the home to public places to the private workplace legislation to restrict where smokers can light up is extremely unlikely even from the most prohibition mind in any smoker and what I mean by that is we're not likely to see anyone proposing a ban on smoking in homes or in private automobiles as the NES pointed out the scientific proof is not there, at least at this point in time to justify restrictions on smoking in public places in the private workplace but that isn't good enough for the Surgeon General it's not good enough for his employees and others in the anti-smoking movement they Place their political agenda above their concerns for scientific objectivity integrity and academic freedom science was never meant to be forced into the position of being a handmaiden for politics but that's the path that's been chosen in this case the tack of the anti smokers on the environmental tobacco smoke issuing the health of, smokers is very simple the science doesn't say what we want to say so let's silence descending viewpoints and go ahead and claim that the science makes our case anyway how would anyone feel confident that they could get away with such a transparent and crude manipulation of science quite simply we're talking about tobacco here we know that you know that I think the Surgeon General and the others in the Attic smoking no movement knows that we're talking about environmental tobacco smoke in particular and for the Surgeon General and others since we're talking about tobacco that means that they feel free to play tennis, this with the net down there's no need for scientific objectivity no need for scientific Integrity no need for tolerance of little nuisances like conflicting viewpoints legitimate conflicting viewpoints and the scientific Community quite simply this fast and loose assault on the facts would not be tolerated if we were talking about anything other than tobacco the number of different reasons why I say that and some of these things are questions issues that John Rumple address in a few minutes Surgeon General has been quoted repeatedly in the mainstream press and the anti-smoking press and, his letters stating in the last couple of years that without the passive smoking issue the anti-smoking movement would have been dead in the water that's his phrase and Ron 1980 and that it's as a result of the fact this passive smoking issue has surfaced that we see restrictions on smoking in some private work places and legislation passed at the city county and state level to restrict smoking what we're suggesting basically is that what's being sacrificed here is scientific objectivity integrity and what's happening specifically is that you have a situation where the Surgeon General the, a health officer of the United States rather than doing his job which is to release objective dispassionate calm the reviews of the scientific literature on specific points whether we're talking about AIDS whether we're talking about smoking whether we're talking talking about any topic what's happening is instead of releasing those reports and leaving at that he's essentially manufacturing the shelves that go right into the guns of City County state federal lawmakers that's the objection we have here it's the abuse of science for political purposes in the Press, leasing in the report in the first section of the report you'll see several cases that discuss specifically how science has been abused for political purposes in the case of environmental tobacco smoke as you'll notice in the press release what we've raised concerns about specifically in relation to the surgeon general's office is a number of different efforts that have been made by persons in the employee of the surgeon general's office to sensor to setting viewpoints and John Ross is going to speak specifically to the case of the scientific conference that's discussed in the first page of the press release and I'll leave that to him well one of the most troubling things we see, here is a repeated and systematic Miss Miss statements on the part of the Surgeon General when it comes to the question of what does the science say about environmental tobacco smoke and lung cancer in non-smokers in 1985 the Surgeon General testified twice before Congress stating that of 15 studies examining a possible link between passive smoking and lung cancer and his words all but three showed a statistically significant positive correlation in other words 12 of the 15 studies he was saying prove that cigarette smoke in the air causes lung cancer, are non-smokers that is demonstrable e false it's simply an accurate he apparently even has recognized that he sends back pedaled and some of his public statements is simply saying that several of the studies show significant correlations in point of fact he's aware of the fact that only four of the studies show a consistent statistical significant correlation between cigarette smoking and lung cancer in non-smokers, sure, I think in this case we're clearly talking about coop as an individual no previous Surgeon General while in office has committed himself to the political agenda of a smoke free Society by the year 2000 no one else has staked their office on that political goal that's clearly what's happened here and that in essence is really the problem that we have beyond that one of the the clear indications that there's a problem here that perhaps even the Surgeon General recognizes himself, is the disparity between his public and private statements at the same time that he's saying that we have all the evidence we need to ban or restrict smoking in private offices and federal Offices as he didn't testifying before Congress on the matter of two bills at two separate occasions last year he has in a letter that's been provided to you stated privately to members of his own profession on an academic level that the viewpoints expressed by scientists who raise very serious concerns that it's simply not accurate to state that there's a direct relationship between cigarette smoking and lung cancer in non-smokers, is accurate that is that they're simply not the scientific basis for making that kind of a flat-out statement right now and I do encourage you to read that letter very closely because it points up a very clear disparity between what he's saying publicly for the sake of getting laws passed and what he's acknowledging privately to his colleagues that's a major problem I'm going to be taking questions after John roughs weeks but I'd like to have my dress specifically the questions of academic freedom and censorship, good morning, the statement professional ethics, of the American Association of University professors declares unequivocally that the primary responsibility of a faculty member to his subject is to seek and to State the truth as he sees it, the university Professor also has a particular obligation according to the aaup statement to promote conditions of free inquiry and a further public understanding of academic freedom, what we're talking about in this press conference is no less than a direct and systematic assault on those fundamental ethical obligations, over a number of years I and a number of other members of our firm have been called upon to Council University professors and a number of colleges and universities around the country concerning a variety of academic freedom issues I frankly do not recall an occasion during the last few years, involving so blatant and attack on academic freedom as we're talking about today, let me give you further details of only one of the several incidents described in the monograph that you've been given earlier this year Professor Sorel Schwartz of Georgetown University, submitted to the tobacco Institute a grant proposal to defray the costs of a medical conference at Georgetown, on the health effects of environmental tobacco smoke, after member companies of The Institute had agreed to provide funding Professor Schwartz invited to the conference scientists with varying viewpoints and areas of expertise to make presentations, shortly after the conference was announced the Georgetown University Administration received a telegram from the American Lung Association requesting cancellation of the conference, in addition officials of The Lung Association and the u.s. office of smoking and health, called scientists who had agreed to participate requesting that they withdraw, the university refused to yield to the intimidation attempts and that was precisely what it was as did many of the scientists, but because of the withdrawal of still other scientists who originally had agreed to participate, Professor Schwartz concluded that he had no choice but to cancel the conference, rather than continue with the program that was incomplete and might be considered by some to be unbalanced, several press reports that followed cancellation of the conference suggested that some of the scientists had withdrawn only after learning that the conference had been made possible by a grant from tobacco companies, such a report appeared for example in the Washington Post in fact it appears that most if not all of the scientists who had originally agreed to participate had been aware of the tobacco Grant from the outset, but viewed from a larger perspective, that fact in any disputes about it are simply beside the point, at no time did anyone associated with the tobacco industry attempt to influence the substance of what individual scientists plan to say at the conference, the expectation was that individual scientists would share, their personal honestly held scientific views concerning environmental tobacco smoke no more could have been asked of the participants no less was expected, but officials of the American Lung Association in the u.s. office on smoking and health apparently concluded that they could not risk or would not tolerate and uncontrolled discussion of the science of environmental tobacco smoke, there is no other way to explain the actions of those officials in successfully forcing cancellation of the conference, one obvious lesson that emerges from the Georgetown incident is of course that when Federal officials having a hand in parceling out hundreds of millions of dollars in research grants each year speak their grantees and prospective grantees listen, or proceed at their peril, as mr. Stagg is mentioned my understanding is that knowledgeable officials at Georgetown University are prepared to discuss this instantly this incident with members of the press unfortunately other scientists against whom threats and other forms of intimidation have been directed either are not prepared to discuss them, or are prepared to do so only on a strict background basis, the intimidation has succeeded in those cases, when scientists are prevented from taking part in scientific discussions because of harassment or intimidation, science is the first casualty and we as members of the public are the second when that harassment and intimidation emanates from our own government, the situation is made all the more lamentable, when the same government officials on an issue like environmental tobacco smoke attempt to pass off political judgments as scientific judgment, the cause for legitimate concern is in my view compounded, those are the issues we've have attempted to address and shed some light on in this press conference, I as well as mr. staff would be prepared to respond anymore",0.8638408626153845,0.53120095,0.9128395

News with Morton Dean and Sheila stainback, there's a fierce battle burning in offices all across America the burning issue is over smoking and whether smokers should be allowed to light up at work where they can potentially affect the health of non-smokers so far about thirty percent of all businesses in the US have policies that restrict where a smoker can smoke and tomorrow the US Surgeon General will release a new report on so-called second hand smoke as Karen has be explains in tonight's Health beat report to heat is really on smokers to bring a breath of fresh air to the office, for smokers to deck outside for a cigarette one relegates it smokers to a spot on the fire escape they hand out smokeless ashtray as they set up separate cafeterias they even sponsor aversion therapy to get smokers to quit companies across the country have become mediators in the ongoing battle between smokers and non-smokers companies are dealing with a smoking issue in a variety of ways one of the strictest is the fortune off jewelry chain here in New York they're currently in court defending their, I see of refusing to hire anyone who admits to being a smoker other companies like Aerospace giant Boeing and cosmetics manufacturer Merle Norman have completely banned smoking from company property at Pacific Northwest Bell offices in Seattle and employee petition led to its smoking ban now smokers line up outside on their brakes making a picture reminiscent of high school days I don't cut down on your smoking cut it in half I don't, it's a very professional look for the company to have people huddled around smoking outside I think it's very true that I don't actually somehow or another that never has seems to me seemed to me to be constitutional many other companies are trying to compromise at Pacific Bell offices in Los Angeles workers voted floor-by-floor whether to allow smoking in their areas when they're showing that people die they literally die from smoking cigarettes and they show the impact that cigarette smoke has, has on non-smokers I feel that there are putting their death sentence on Zoomies I don't feel as productive in the sense that I don't concentrate and I'm constantly running someplace to have a cigarette other approaches include giving smokers are filters and smokeless ashtrays clustering smokers at one end of a floor and allowing people with private offices to designate their spaces as smoking or non-smoking areas according to a consumer reports article the more expensive air filters, do a better job than the cheaper ones but none are as effective as opening a window all these techniques have their critics and as a result many companies have turned to Robert Rosner and Bill Weiss they operate the not-for-profit smoking policy Institute where they create plans for other companies to deal with the smoking issue they say that in addition to health benefits helping employees to quit can save companies a lot of money you look at the absenteeism issue that smokers are absent a lot more than not, smokers you look at issues like maintenance of facilities and property damage you look at things like productivity and lawsuits the bottom line is smoking is a very expensive behavior in the work environment whether the new surgeon general's report convinces more companies to limit smoking remains to be seen but those who are in the business of getting people to quit think they've spotted a trend this ashtray in the corporate environment is going to be as rare as the spittoon is smoking is on its way out, for the independent news in New York I'm Karen has bee, at 5:00 New York's number one source for news this is Eyewitness News with Ernie Anastos Roz Abrams storm field and the Eyewitness News Team it now appears that certain healthy people run the risk of developing lung cancer and other diseases simply by inhaling the smoke of others in fact is Surgeon General C Everett Koop says that there is an indisputable link between passive smoke and lung disease John Bascom now has more about today's report on the dangers of passive, Surgeon General C Everett Koop in his first public appearance following surgery says now for the first time there's reason to warn non-smokers about the hazards of being around people who smoke it is now clear that disease risk due to inhalation of tobacco smoke is not solely limited to the individual who was smoking but can also extend to those individuals who inhale tobacco smoke in room air he said there's also a risk of respiratory problems for small, children around parents who smoke it is imperative that parents eliminate tobacco smoke exposure from their child's environment the Surgeon General says simply separating smokers and non-smokers does not eliminate the problem and suggested it's time to ban smoking in the workplace the right of the smoker to smoke stops at the point where his or her smoking increases the disease risk to those occupying that same, Armand representatives of the Heart Association The Lung Association and the Cancer Society endorse the report and said it's time now for federal legislation to restrict smoking on all commercial airplanes John Bascom ABC News Washington here in New York officials have been talking for the last six months about a proposal to ban smoking in city offices Doug Johnson joins us now with an update on how this effort is going Doug well Roz are smoking ban has been proposed in a number of cities but when you, do anything in New York it's always a bigger problem but like City governments everywhere hours moves gingerly Association survey showed 87 percent of those polled to prove to smoking limits in the workplace but to translate that into abandoned city offices is not easy rights of those who do not smoke our preeminent because it was last July that mayor Koch announced his plan to ban smoking in All City workspace the first city agency to implement the no smoking ban is, Department of Health which has about 5,000 employees so carefully has the department of health gone about the smoking ban they have appointed a full-time own boatsman to see that the plan was implemented phase one was Banning smoking in public areas like bathrooms that presented some problems in restrooms a kennel for that because they don't have anyone around to enforce rules it is up to the employees to understand both smokers and non-smokers alike to understand the benefits of this program what we, try to get employees to do and to say if there is smoking in the bathroom and we know that it is guess the regulation that you tell the employee that you reported his supervisor the Department of Health has provided a smoking area for those employees who want to smoke it's not fancy but it is an area nonetheless but what if smokers don't find Provisions in city offices satisfactory when it's not possible to to have a shared workspace by smokers and non-smokers then the nun smoke, right the one that we try to protect is that non-smokers right that we are trying to implement this program for, now interestingly enough only about 1% of the Department of Health employees have been involved in any kind of complaint but after all it is the Department of Health and they do have their own Ombudsman who is seeing this through now there are about 50 Union locals in city government

we have a Hot Topic special report for you tonight on a health issue that's fast becoming all-out War where there's smoke there's fire,is the title of our look at the battle between smokers and non-smokers already public smoking is close to becoming a social taboo now if this battle goes on it could become a habit that strictly for the privacy of the home 20 years ago the Surgeon General linked to cancer now the surgeon general's calling for a smoke-free America by the year 2000, 55 million Americans are feeling the pressure to kick the habit secondhand smoke is the issue it's not just a health hazard it's a smelly old nuisance can he win some smoking very aware of the smoking clothing and rooms and things like that no one thinks themselves at the Marlboro Man anymore I don't like what it's doing to my health inhaling their smoke I was at a party the other evening there was only one leader smoking among about 200 people and she blushed slightly and put out a cigarette so I think there's quite an increasing social, so the smokeless the party may just be over for smokers some of whom resent the pressure Boston socialite Phyllis nayar among them yes there's a certain house to sue had signs in her living room saying thank you for not smoking I would never go back there being ill mannered bad-tempered hostile and I just find that very hard to deal with colors of changed for the smoker in the Hollywoods Heyday it was chic, get them in those days along with the smoking came the image of an actress can the image of a star it was quite an interesting accessory in the fashion field 50 years ago Mildred Albert established the academy modern which was one of this nation's first finishing schools for young women and then of the 1940s she started the heart agency which was the city's first modeling agency and she remembers how smoking was considered to be Chic and fashionable for women during those days you very casually, took out your beautiful cigarette case opened it to come to a long cigarette holder put the cigarette in and all the sudden you were a star the tobacco industry spends two and a half billion dollars a year trying to convince an increasingly skeptical public smoking is still attractive he is one of the fashion trend setters of America Don Johnson Miami Vice caught he still smokes but his real life God, departs on the Holden Police Department have agreed not to smoke either on or off the job I think a lot of the glamour has gone out of it people don't see the image that they used to see because I'm in the business world I have to accept it but I just don't like it I sort of think it's rude to do it till smoking bills are before the state legislature this year one would further restrict public smoking and another would force employers to establish smoking policies and we'll be looking at all the jobs smoking a little later this week and tomorrow we will hear, a smoker who's suing for Millions because he's sick now and he can't lick the Habit that's tomorrow at 11 where there's smoke there's fire everybody's got an opinion on it you bet they do and they're very vocal about it too, w:n e@v TV channel seven Boston the station that has once again received the Emmy for New England's outstanding newscast and now Tom Ellis the on Willis Harvey Leonard and John Dennis together bringing the day's news home to you this is the New England news good evening everyone coming up next the battle between smokers and non-smokers Tom will continue his special series on how that Hot Topic with, look at how the tobacco industry tonight fits into that controversy and we'll hear from both sides there's a protest in Worcester tonight as the anti-smoking group gasp took on the Virginia Slims tennis tournament about a dozen protesters marched outside the Centrum where that tennis event opened today the match is sponsored by the Philip Morris Tobacco Company makers of Virginia Slims cigarettes the protesters say the sponsorship of this match is a move to get more women customers well that protest is just one more indication of what, Hot Topic for debate over smoking has become and this week we're taking a look at that debate and a special series of reports where there's smoke there's fire tonight should a tobacco industry be forced to pay for the damage it causes many people are insisting it should, it is a 30 million dollar a year business with 600 billion cigarettes sold last year but demand for the product is falling so farmers are starting to grow other crops and tobacco companies are relying more on other products but the real threat to Tobacco economics comes from smokers who've become ill 67 years ago my doctor exam my lungs he said they were bad and getting worse but diagnosis for 60 year old job Hess of Lynn it, Seema it's doctor gives him three years to live yet he has been unable to quit what he calls a 45-year addiction so he's suing the Philip Morris tobacco company for five million dollars when I was 14 and one told me that, like they say now that the Surgeon General says is hazardous to your health they didn't tell me that then perhaps I never would have started smoke 20 years ago the Surgeon General issued his warning of the dangers of cigarettes it's charged the tobacco companies already knew smoking was dangerous and addictive something they still don't admit mr. has this case if mr. has had been warned he would have not smoked it's our contention that the ninety percent of the people out there would not have smoked if if the tobacco companies were responsible and presented, the evidence as they knew it at the time and the critics charge not only did the warning labels come too late even today they are too weak reason These Warnings have been some mealy-mouthed is that the tobacco industry fought them tooth and nail and they made them just as weak and vague and unscary as could possibly be one of the purpose of a warning is to tell people this thing's really dangerous dr. Richard dainard heads the tobacco products liability project which lost a similar case against the RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company, last month but with dozens of other cases already pending lawyers are certain the tables will turn I think the day that wasn't the tobacco companies admit that they have a dangerous product is the day they fear that the floodgates open and there are hundreds of thousands of cases pouring in I think it's a case of just denying denying denying and hoping that people go away a spokesman for the tobacco Institute refused to comment on the cases, but their position is clear smoking is a matter of choice you think you're covered as far as liability is concerned with the warnings that currently exists on so we know that the American public has a full understanding of the range of concerns that have been raised about smoking you also have to make a decision about individual responsibility the responsibility of individuals to make their own decisions look at the evidence still for John Hess the evidence may have come too late that day, Doom is just an and can reverse that, I think my life is probably been shot and 20 to 30 years because of this, I think, the tobacco companies should be held responsible for that that estimated 800 people die in this country every day from diseases caused by smoking if and when one of those lawsuits is decided against a tobacco company the people who are against tobacco hope that the price of cigarettes will Skyrocket and that the industry that's the tobacco industry then we'll be forced to cover smokers Health costs a tomorrow we continue our Special Report with a look at smoking on the job and why it, errors that might be on its way out at least it for many Massachusetts companies that's certainly the case and it's pretty controversial I know one thing that isn't controversial this weather, WN TV TV channel seven Boston the station that is once again received the Emmy for New England's outstanding newscast and now Tom Ellis neon Willis Harvey Leonard and John Dennis together bringing the day's news home to you this is the New England news so coming up this evening I'll wrap up my special series on smoking and your rights tonight we look at the battle over lighting up in the workplace smokers, versus non-smokers that's a Hot Topic these days and it's the subject this week of a series of special reports on the New England news tonight the conclusion of where there's smoke there's fire and our Focus this time tonight is on smoking on the job not might surprise you but a lot of smokers we spoke with say they actually would appreciate being told they can't smoke while working and that just may be the wave of the Future No Smoking sections and restaurants whether they are there's the result of local legislation or voluntary action are something we've come to expect, but now non-smokers can rent rooms at a growing list of hotels and they can even rent cars that have never been sullied by tobacco but the fiercest Battle of all against the but as being waged on the job as the controversy between smokers and non-smokers continues to grow so does the list of companies that don't allow smoking in the workplace anymore and by March 1st New England telephone will be on that list twenty-nine thousand employees and within seven weeks not one of them will be smoking on the job, the new rules are the result of a four-year study which showed among other things that smokers were actually in favor of this new policy you don't think it's an infringement on your rights as a smoker no I don't well I think that's actually good for me in that it's going to give me the incentive I'm not going to be able to smoke on my desk I really don't think I'll have much of a problem I think probably will help to quit in fact a recent Gallup poll shows that 80% of the smokers questioned agreed no smoking at the workplace is a, good idea I want to quit now because I'm pregnant to help employees kick the habit completely the phone company offers cessation courses free of charge and on company time they figure the payback will come in the form of fewer sick days and lower insurance rates by some estimates are Savings of four thousand dollars per employee per year good health is becoming good business you know it's ironic that the computer industry builds a machine that cannot tolerate smoke computers, major computers have to be in a smoke-free environment and yet we don't insist that our workers are human workers are treated the same way that's not the case at this computer software company in Cambridge Javelin Incorporated when it opened in 1984 the chairman of the board brought Furman and his partner decided they'd go smokeless it was now or never in terms of setting up a policy that we either should do it now or forget it because later it would be very difficult to convert a company that was filled with, a to a non-smoking company talking of Big Ticket items so no one here has to worry about a smoky staff meeting and while a few of them are smokers when they agreed to take the job they agreed to the rules they will not smoke on the premises of Javelin for all their own Javelin business with other Javelin employees, so they know that upfront before they start work hundreds of Massachusetts companies already have gone but no smoking route and if a proposed bill passes this year all employers will be forced to consider smoking policies for non-smokers who now have the luxury of Clean Air could they ever go back probably demand oxygen at my desk well here's a little more information for you if you are a smoker or a nonsmoker interested in a smoking policy where you work the, long Association is all kinds of literature that can help you work things out with your employer remember so far in terms of court cases actually pursued over this issue it is the smoker who because of the dangers of that secondhand smoke issue it is the smoker who basically has no rights I things are changing I got to tell you something yeah congratulations you stop smoking as a result of the series dr. Katie man we interviewed for this series way back on the 2nd of January, convince me I don't know I don't know after a few minutes with this guy I just didn't want to go I'm proud that's a cute",0.8295963384375,0.538224,0.912839

Harbaugh shouldn't have he should have treated your sister like a child even though she was a grown educated woman he should have done his job he should have assumed that she didn't know what was good for her and made decisions that were rightfully Barbara Rosen you saw what Peter did and you did nothing move to strike, my sister get killed, okay let's tackle The Limited Partnerships right we have all the prospectus has on file including favourable opinions by two major accounting firms are indexed by year but we also have cross files by Venture and state Miss Taylor ran mr.

Shepherd two years ago and doctors told me was from years of breathing smoke growing up in a house with both parents smoked that's just wrong excuse me sir you are not the witness here tomorrow you will be the witness that's when I'll be asking the questions don't threaten my clients trying to shed some light here he seems a bit confused with let's get on with it, the doctors made no conclusive findings about your exact cause of cancer now did they serve they said they thought it had to be from learning I think is what the you interrupted again don't make me smack you this is a deposition mr. Mulaney not a rugby match in any more comments from you and I will suspend this proceeding and move for sanctions to take up a judge's time with a stupid motion like that he'll be glad I smacked you, did the doctors conclusively find that your lung cancer was caused by secondhand smoke that was their opinion their opinion, thank you okay we're done this proceeding is adjourned, we'll see you all tomorrow, just a little more up here and we're in business should use my free turn another letter I could have solved it, okay you're all set he's have to be a size smaller cutting off my circulation hi hi you know I've been a big admirer of yours for some time now please there's no conversation with this y OU k no conversation I'm just going to take my shot I'm out in the industry I'm just a boring corporate attorney who leaves a very dull life but I happen to have 8:00 reservations at Le Dome tomorrow night will I be eating alone yes you will regulations were not allowed to have any contact, heck with contestants during the game I say so if it wasn't against federal law you might consider it cute, cute this woman was your patient doctor I did everything I could to help Bob erosion I really did besides treating her physical injuries what did you do I listen to her I urged you to get marriage counseling a go into therapy I even tried talking to Peter but he wouldn't admit that he had a problem what about mrs. Rosen did she respond to your suggestion no no she begged me not to tell anyone she was so sure that Peter was going to change I tried to, that he wouldn't think you're trying more than once every time she came in with an injury but talking about it only made her feel worse she was scared that people were going to find out that Peter was going to divorce her and take away her children dr. Harbaugh do you feel you fulfilled your professional obligations to Barbara's mm yes I diagnosed her and I strongly recommended a course of treatment but there was nothing more that I could do thank you doctor, dr. horrible, why was it that you didn't report to the authorities that Barbara Rosen was being abused by her husband she made it clear that she didn't want me to so what if you were treating a child that you suspected of being abused barbaro's and wasn't a child and dr. art you required by California law to report any case involving injuries that you reasonably believe were inflicted by criminal act yes well I'm going to refer to your own medical notes here sir July 20th 1989 quote the patient suffered severe, as well as a concussion appears to have been struck by a blunt instrument you didn't consider that to be a criminal act I had no proof that she was struck by anybody well why don't you tell the police the police aren't going to act on a doctor suspicion why didn't you at least report it to them and give him a chance because all they would have happened was Barbara would have sued me for breaching confidentiality oh so that's why you decided to stay quiet fear of being sued is that's one reason the other reason is that I am also required by law to uphold the confidentiality of, my patient and my patient asked me to stay quiet for your patient wasn't in control here doctor she was being terrorized by her husband obviously her judgment that's a psychiatric observation counselor I'm not a psychiatrist I'm dr. you knew what she was headed for hey I want my alcoholic patients to stop drinking most don't I urge battered wives to leave their husbands most don't one more time I'm going to go back to your own records here because mrs. rosen's injuries for progressively getting worse they weren't just black guys, broken ribs you had two concussions here a broken nose but what doctor what were you waiting for this is Brad Radley will Heroes and have had to hurt your patient before you would have done something to help her what a broken neck fracture how much does it take before you decide to get involved doctor, so there I am with the love of my college life and I'm crazy about this girl friend we go to this very fancy restaurant which I can't afford now this place is very romantic and it's got candles and table and everything I got these huge menus I'm reading the menu and I don't realize that the menu is perched right over here know you did oh I did so all of a sudden I hear this scream and I look up my menu is burning and I'm taking the maitre d is, around the waiter comes over the table grabs the water and he throws it not on the Flames not on the menu right on my girlfriend no she dried out eventually but the relationship was never the same thanks for dinner Stuart I had a wonderful time thanks for your help I couldn't have done it without you yes you could know I couldn't your one all of his support staff, and you are one hell of a lawyer, Stewart we can't do this, can't, yeah right we can I'm sorry I could just like Arnie Becker didn't I you could never be like Arnie Becker your indecent mature man, and if you weren't married maybe things would be different but you are and I work for you and I don't want that to change neither do I, this was all my fault you don't have to worry about your job no, but to get back to it yeah I just have to print out the final draft I'll clean up tomorrow no rush no rush so did you ever go back to the shape here oh yeah yeah one time years later is a laundromat than the restaurant burned down but I had nothing to do with it I didn't, let's go home Stewart, so in your opinion dr. Cahill the defendant should have intervened of course simply treating a patient's, is not enough if a doctor is aware of the underlying disease of abuse he has to do everything he can to cure it even if a patient like Barbara Rose and denies that the abuse is occurring especially then denial by the victim is is a symptom it's part of being terrorized by the battery only cure for it is to bring the truth out in the open you know dr. this is It's a husband and wife thing right mean if she chooses not to going to the FBI 34% of all female homicide victims, over the age of 15 and the murdered by their husbands or by an intimate partner this man didn't need to rely on statistics he knew the husband was the abuser is continued silence was gross malpractice those are strong words doctor sometimes strong words can save a life objection sustained I have nothing further, you're asking my client to play social worker I'm asking that he take care of his patients he was suffering from a disease called domestic violence and he failed to treat it so we should abolish doctor-patient privilege these cases are unique the you're advocating right now the abolition of doctor-patient privilege yes or no yes and they should be at the doctor's discretion at his whim he should be able to disregard the confidentiality of a patient it's better than letting her be beaten to death, have you ever reported the abuse of a patient doctor yes twice did the police do anything no but that doesn't mean the very possible that nothing would have happened in Barbara Rosen case had my client reported this isn't it you still should have tried he should have betrayed his patients trust this is Rose and needed help she was in a state of emotional Perales notional paralysis that's a psychiatric opinion, doctor are you a psychiatrist no I'm not neither is dr. Harbaugh are you suggesting you should have used common sense and once again by Common Sense you mean that the doctor should have overridden the clear expressed intent of one of his competent adult patients true or false, true but likes doctor I got it, nothing further, Whelan just told me about Totten congratulations thanks, what's wrong you go out with guys much sometimes no I mean you have a lot of friends, wow fuel close ones I guess I don't, I have my work and I have an and I have Matthew, and I said, the hell you talking about Stewart, I kissed another woman, I wanted to do it and I did it and she didn't kiss me I kissed her, I don't know who I am anymore my I'm not a good husband and I don't feel like a good lawyer you're a great lawyer Stewart hell you just beat the IRS you have a wife and a son who loved you, so you had a heart attack you're human, no sense of myself anymore Mike, nothing feels like, like me you know, you talk to him about it, we try to talk but we don't we we can't even argue anymore, I wasn't running to another woman I was running away from me you still love her, I do, I'm trying again, I think I can, yes hello Douglas is your good friend Arnie here what are you doing at my secretary station oh well I just happened to be nearby when I saw a Miss Vanna White approaching she doesn't, howíd shall I send her away very funny why don't the two of you go off and have a bowel movement together, now that's a pretty nasty thing to say don't you think you told me that you lost yesterday looks to me like you won pretty big could I have a minute with him alone oh sure and I'll tell you what if the cat doesn't give him back his tongue office is just two doors down great, why are you here I'm sorry but I just thought that since you're off the show now it wouldn't be illegal for you and me to be friends now I know it's a joke all right Arnie you can come in it's no joke you seem very nice and when I told you about the FCC regulations you seem to receive it as a polite form of rejection and I wanted you to know that wasn't the case, would you, would you like to have a date well how about a simple lunch no cash prizes no assortment of sumptuous gifts just a hamburger by the beach I'd love it tomorrow 1:00 perfect we'll talk in the morning and make a plan see ya, bye, got snide if you want counsel the secondary smoke does not cause lung cancer you are aware that the United States surgeon general's office says that he does their own and would the New England Journal of Medicine also be wrong when it says that secondhand smoke causes almost 7,000 deaths annually in this country alone we don't agree with their data but you are aware of their data aren't you mr. McGarry yes we are and are you also aware of the recent, medical reports which say that the risk of lung cancer is nearly double for all people exposed to secondhand smoke during early childhood it has been brought to our attention well with all this information in your possession are you doing anything to warn the nonsmoker we're but warnings and all of our packaging which one the smoker what are you doing to warn the nonsmoker that they're at risk to the law does not compel us to do so what about human safety you don't find that compelling I need a moment, no I'm not going off the record my client please make note for the record that attorneys flower tea and stagger or whispering in the respective years of the witness please further know my amazement at the witnesses ability to listen to two people simultaneously I object to that that was mr. Statler mr. flower tea is still Whispering even if we are aware of the alleged dangers of second-hand smoke we had no reason to be aware of those dangers at the time that mr. Sheppard was exposed to his parents smoking what a lovely answer, was that mr. flower teased or mr. Statler this is abusive I am sorry mr. McGarry but your company certainly knew about the dangers of cigarette smoking 30 years ago didn't it from a smoke yes well did you do any testing on the dangers of secondhand smoke I don't believe we did so maybe the reason that you didn't know about the risks was that you never did any tests right any particular are you want that answer whispered into we can test for everything for God's sake well yeah, you test for Taste and your test for the color of the packaging and you test the commercials to see which you're most effective but you can't test to see who your smoke kills none of the others did why should we why should we I'm going to recommend we terminate this deposition this deposition is over Michael silly thing to say, I'd like you to know something nothing ever happened between Stewart and me we have a professional relationship and that's all, do you feel better now, last call oh no thank you I'd like to get some sleep before next week you're right you have to stuff grown in here, probably, there's something on your mind how about made a settlement offer 25,000, you don't take it plant will go for it, I keep telling her 25 something yeah but I keep thinking to myself if we settle this thing quietly what about all those other defenses women who's going to help them, it doesn't just happen to defenseless women Victor, it can happen to anybody, you, in my second year of law school I was seeing a professor, I was too young to realize that if he got off on controlling women, when I started to resist he hit me and then he would tell me how stupid I was and that I would never be able to practice law and that I was completely worthless, for a while I believed him, finally I left but I will never forget the way he made me feel, did you tell anybody no, I was afraid of what it said about me, of the look I am getting from you right now, Grace it doesn't say anything about you or use the sick one not you but it does change the way you think about me, doesn't it you didn't before but now you see me as a victim, just a little, domestic violence is the single most common cause of injury to women in this country today more common than car accidents muggings and rapes combined as many as 35 percent of women who visit emergency rooms are treated for ongoing physical abuse 1/3 of all pregnant women, physically abused regardless of race educational background class in America every 18 seconds a woman is battered and every year 1500 women are battered to death well look around you ladies and gentlemen really, because chances are that the woman sitting next to you or the one sitting next to her as at some time in their lives been physically abused but you would never know it, partly because the police and doctors like dr. Harbaugh don't really want to get involved they stay silent and they make it possible for battered women to continue to be abused and sometimes murdered now his lawyer talks about respecting the wishes of this patient, this doctor new is patient was incapable of helping herself here he diagnosed it he also ignored his duty under California law that requires him to report physical violence he disregarded his patient he disregarded the law and as a result while Rosen is dead, all that is necessary for evil to Triumph is that good men do nothing Stephen Harbaugh did nothing ladies and gentlemen right now he's hoping you'll do the same thank you, if we start forcing doctors to be whistleblowers you know what happens, you eliminate doctor-patient privilege and battered wise and any other people that have secrets that they don't want to be discovered will stay away from doctors people who need medical attention won't get it because they'll be too afraid to come forward suddenly going to your doctor will become tantamount to going to the police, my God, wouldn't George Orwell be happy about that competent adult suddenly robbed of their right to privacy you and I suddenly forced to Forfeit confidentiality with our own Physicians, you cannot of course battering is a horrible crime and there's nobody here that shouldn't grieve for Barbara Rosen Stephen Harbaugh breathe he recommended that she seek psychiatric treatment he pleaded with her to leave her husband he did everything he could accept abandoned the trust that Barbara Rosen had placed with him, Stephen Harbaugh is not responsible for Barbara rosen's death and you know that, all right 600,000 sealed you don't even whisper to each other I told you a million five would you think I was kidding no Justin saying Michael the man never smoked a cigarette in his life he is dying of lung cancer still difficult to prove in court again less difficult with every new study that comes out okay let's stop this silly nonsense shall we you cannot risk this case there is no contributory negligence defense against the nonsmoker no Assumption of risk not to, mention the fact that my mother died from your little cancer stick shift corporate piece at felt then I'll make it my life mission to get even I won't stay for this this Cowboy tactics won't fly oh they will fly with the jury mr. flower tea and you know why cause I'm going to pointed a man who's dying of cancer whose lungs are corroded away a man who will be dead within a year and then I'm going to point eight you CEO of the company that gave him cancer company that you would smoke was poison and by your own admission in the deposition yesterday a company that didn't even, bother to check the dangers of secondhand smoke and why because instead of netting 62 million dollars a year in profit you wanted to net 63, no I think you'll want to see yourself in front of a jury mr.

PLANNING CIPOLLONE TOBACCO TRIAL COVERAGE HIGHLIGHTS LENGTH - 11:53,1988,Duplicate of Bates 91783521/3522.,"tobacco, cigarette,lawsuit , individual lawsuit , tobacco industry lawyer , public relations , mass media , tobacco related health concerns, legal activity , product liability , court decision",tobacco_kxw99d00,"a landmark verdict in the closely watched chip alone case came on Monday June 13th 1988 at 5 p.m. defense attorneys were made available for immediate interviews and comments at the courthouse to ensure a balanced coverage as news of the verdict broke it was a complete Victory a complete Vindication of my client and lorillard I think the jury's decision is also significant in that it is a victory for all three two,and then send for the industry on the most serious charges that were levied that is the charges of Fraud and conspiracy and we're very pleased that the jury has rejected plaintiffs claims of Fraud and plaintiffs claims of conspiracy and is basically held the defense position in this case that the plaintiff is responsible for her knowing actions and conduct like all other American juries this jury concluded that people who smoke have a freedom to choose and they are, responsible for their choice and that I think came out loud and clear in this verdict, this is the CBS Evening News I'm Charles kuralt sitting in for damn rather good evening for the first time I'll tobacco company was found legally liable today for contributing to the death of a cigarette smoker but it was a qualified defeat for the tobacco interests so much so that both sides managed to claim victory after today's verdict in a federal court in Newark New Jersey Richard Schlessinger has our report well there was some good news for the tobacco industry in today's verdict the jury, underrated Liggett lorillard and Philip Morris of charges they conspired to mislead the public about the hazards of cigarettes and in another decision that can only be viewed as a victory for the tobacco companies the jury decided mrs. chip alone was 80% responsible for her own death largely agreeing with tobacco industry claims but smoking is a matter of choice NBC Nightly News with Tom Brokaw good evening our tobacco companies liable if people who smoke their cigarettes die, cancer yes and no according to a federal court jury which tonight returned a verdict in a major case on this important question and be ceased and Bernard with more tonight on this complicated case from Newark New Jersey the six-member jury found the three tobacco companies were not guilty of Fraud and did not conspire to conceal the harmful effects of smoking this was the first case in which a judge allowed evidence of such a conspiracy and the jury ruled that the evidence was insufficient very pleased that the jury has rejected, plaintiffs claims of Fraud and plaintiffs claims of conspiracy and is basically held the defense position and he stays today's verdict is likely to dampen down the enthusiasm by attorneys who take these cases and have to finance them hoping for a big win and then the big fees from ABC this is World News Tonight with Peter Jennings sitting in tonight Barry Serafin good evening for the first time a tobacco company has been found liable for contributing to a smoker's death, that was the verdict today by a federal jury and a highly publicized case in Newark New Jersey but it was only a partial defeat for the industry the three tobacco companies that were on trial here in federal court insisted that they were pleased with the jury's verdict it is a victory for all three defendants and for the industry on the most serious charges that were levied that is the charges of Fraud and conspiracy, this is ABC News Nightline substituting for Ted Koppel and Reporting from Washington James Walker at first glance it looks like a clear-cut victory for anti-smoking forces who have been suing the tobacco companies for over 30 years why then after the verdict were lawyers for the tobacco companies proclaiming victory for the tobacco industry which through 50-odd lawyers and a battalion of public relations troops into the chip alone case the four hundred thousand dollar reward may have been cause for celebration, what they thought was originally the sexiest most exciting part of the case a jury rejected and I just doubt very seriously if it's going to encourage a lot of people to bring lawsuits will just have to wait and see topping the news this morning both sides claimed victory in a cigarette lawsuit this is NBC News at sunrise for tobacco industry lawyers felt they had beaten back a new tactic a charge of Fraud and conspiracy to hide the dangers of smoking it's hard for me to imagine that a lot of, going to jump in and bring new lawsuits when 400,000 dollar recovery is all you can look forward to after many many years of very hard-nosed litigating to maximize coverage of the defense reaction TV stations across the country were offered live interviews with industry attorneys via satellite 47 stations conducted interviews which were aired on 59 newscasts reaching more than 43 million viewers in a satellite interview the defense attorney in the landmark court case so this, it would not open a Floodgate for similar lawsuits it's a 400 death thousand dollar return if it's ever collected on an investment that the plaintiff lawyers say themselves was in between 2 million and 3 million dollars in time and expenses so I don't think it's a very good return for them and I don't think if I were a plaintiff's lawyer that I would want to bring this type of case is look at accept any moral responsibility for Rose chip alone's death absolutely not there's no reason to do, that and seeing the surgeon general's report she saw the warnings on the packages and the jury in this case accepted the fundamental argument that the defendants tobacco companies have been advancing in this case and other cases with respect to that and that is no recovery for somebody who makes their own decision to use any product when they're aware of the risks of that product and joining us live now to talk about the verdict is Robert Northrup and attorney for the Philip Morris company one of those on trial and newer I think the allocation of responsibility is set, doubt but the jury in this case indicated that they still feel that an individual has a choice and I don't think it's been shown that cigarettes are addictive and in any case we all know that millions of people have quit smoking Steven parish is joining us right now he was part of the defense team for Phyllis Philip Morris and lorillard Incorporated which one that Landmark case and he joins us live from New Jersey via satellite to discuss the case I would still say this is a victory for the cigarette industry and I will tell you why, before this case started we were told that this was going to be a new Theory a new approach that was going to turn the tide against the cigarette industry in the way the plaintiff's lawyer was going to do that was by presenting company documents and alleging that there was a conspiracy among the cigarette companies where we had four and a half months of trial and a lot of documents shown to the jury and yesterday they they unanimously agree that there was no conspiracy there was no misrepresentation, and there was no fraud there was no concealment in studio interviews were secured for attorneys on National and international news programs for a total of 63 million impressions we're gonna spend a lot of time in the courtroom are you not mr. Kang no I don't think so I don't think this is going to increase the number of cases I think they will decrease the bottom line here is that I think most plaintiffs lawyers who read this transcript of this trial and see the charges will understand that they can't hope to get his sympathetic that, judges mr. Adel have had and that it's not worth the effort that this jury therefore say everybody smokes cigarettes there's an inherent warranty from that company that it will be safe I'm not aware of any claim we're under a theory of Express warranty in the past someone has relied on an advertisement 30-odd years ago as a guarantee that one would not contract disease I think it's a unique application of the express warranty Theory and that's one of the reasons why I think Elizabeth Leggett has a very solid basis for, repealing the verdict the important thing is that the result on this breach of warranty or contract claim had nothing to do with these documents that so much has been made to do about on the day after the verdict a Press Conference was held in Manhattan with 125 reporters and financial analysts and attendance the jury's decision was hailed as a victory for the tobacco industry that makers went on the offensive today one day after the first verdict holding a tobacco company liable for our smokers, cancer but Tobacco Company attacks a lawyers for Antonio chip alone who was awarded four hundred thousand dollars for his wife roses death from cancer the real story of this litigation is not a woman from New Jersey who smoked but about money money and about three very big very rich New Jersey Law Firms one day after the verdict in New Jersey's landmark tobacco lawsuit both sides are refusing to admit defeat the verdict in the chip alone case is clearly, victory for the cigarette manufacturers and any effort to characterize it otherwise is a distortion this trial was said to be different from all the other liability suits because of the internal cigarette company documents introduced by the plaintiff at their news conference the cigarette companies fired back with their own stack of memos while claiming the plaintiffs paper trail and Court LED nowhere there were no smoking guns among those company papers anti-smoking groups are breathing easier tonight following what they are calling a partial victory, Dre their first-ever this comes from yesterday's Federal Court decision in New Jersey which pitted a widower against three of the largest tobacco companies but as Eric Shawn reports the tobacco industry is taking the verdict in stride 37 years at the smoking and health controversy has been raging this industry acted responsibly the cigarette lawyer struck back at a packed press conference they attack ship alone's lawyers the judge the Surgeon General and smoking opponents noting chip alone was awarded only a fraction of his, legal teams estimated expenses industry lawyers tried to downplay the significance of other lawsuits this is a clear demonstration for those that these cases are just not worth pursuing extensive television radio and print coverage resulted in more than 180 million impressions following the press conference the industry's claim a victory continued to make headlines in newspapers, radio stations Nationwide broadcast prepackaged feeds and live interviews reaching 43 million listeners we won this case insofar as the major claims are concerned and I think Liggett has a very strong basis for appeal on the one claim which the jury returned a verdict against them analysts agree that the cigarette companies came out on top the fact that the jury found Mississippi alone 80% and responsible for her choice, the smoke and for her injury was the most important point about go stocks fell on news of the verdict but analysts predict they'll soon bounce back these companies are so strong financially in their earnings are going up so well they're among the best managed companies in the world we think that this verdict stands for one proposition and one proposition only and that is that in the 30 some years that the smoking and health controversy has been raging this industry acted responsibly, possibly it addressed the issues in a straightforward manner it funded millions of dollars of independent research both outside and in house and attempted in every way possible to try to address the criticisms that were being leveled against these products",0.8244483544000001,0.71364504,0.9128391

""THE LIBERTAD FORUM ON COMMERCIAL FREE SPEECH""",1993,"The LibertAd Forum participants discuss issues related to free speech, First amendment, and advertising.","tobacco, cigarette,advertising, marketing, legal right, lawyer, business activity",tobacco_cub77c00,"freedom of commercial speech is as vital to our Democratic process is freedom of religious political and artistic speech,remember to handful of people to say but some forms of free speech are not as free as others is to abdicate freedom of choice and undermine the foundations of free societies everywhere in the fall of each year at the Harriman New York country Campus of Columbia University and international group of distinguished jurist lawyers legislators journalist authors Executives and representatives of,Communications and entertainment Industries need to discuss issues concerning free speech and democracy issues that touch the lives of free people everywhere, in my view there aren't a lot of people who really believe in the First Amendment most people tend to believe or to want to allow the sort of speech they find congenial and that is true in all areas of speech whether it is political speech or commercial speech all the more necessary in my view is it to have as categorical protections for speech as possible as few distinctions as possible, it's impossible to say that the constitution itself draws any distinction between economic rights and the other personal rights I think the close relationship between pre markets and free speech and political Freedom ultimate human Liberty is is undeniable the First Amendment includes the right of free association it's not all that easy to distinguish between so-called political and economic associations because, most of our political associations are organized for economic purposes of course if we view speech and conversation in the continuing debate as an end in itself I think we might reach a different conclusion on Commercial speech as well as other areas of speech in immediate Court said as we lead the Oregon cases it's really the Oregon Constitution we are not going to distinguish something called commercial speech from something that is any other kind of speech to text of the First Amendment doesn't mention political speech, nor commercial speech and I think the surest most consistent and certainly most principled Safeguard is to do what I gather as just as Linda you refers to an organ you know make a distinction where the statute or the Constitutional provision doesn't have it, now one doesn't have to be a hyper littlest to see the danger of letting the government the very government of the first amendment is designed to rein in Define which speech has high value and which speech has lower value in fact in political speech we can be told lies and it's a lot tougher to protect ourselves is the conclusion we got to have him start regulating the political speech at this point I don't know what is politics other than the pursuit of power and if you've got the power, you've got the politics and if you've got the power you'll Define Freedom as you choose to free to Define freedom I think if there's any argument at all for advertising being regulated political advertising gets it the most because if you buy a different brand of chicken and I do I could care less but if you vote for someone based on a promise that will never be realized and it's not properly discounted it's going to affect me it scares the hell out of me too, the most painful denial of freedom of the most painful thing was that you were denied the basic right to pass judgment on anything you were denied the right to say what do you think about world since we human beings differ from animals exactly by our capacity to formulate judgments, the separation of this freedom in fact that used us the status of Edibles as we consider this situation where what did they fight for not only freedom of Oppression but also Freedom from Want, and as they try to reconstruct their countries they realize that there is such a necessity and economic Port consideration of how to build up a mode of living whereby everybody has a good life we are focusing in Poland very much on political Freedom entertainment out enough and had in attention to things like like commercial free speech, the first things must come first we are developing this free market institutions and this is the part and parcel of it the subject of our International for room inspires me as person but also as in Hungarian citizen who knows very well what is exactly the meaning of freedom and what it means not to have it it is a fact that the only way news media can survive, free and independently is file support of advertising, one magazine that has no advertising its Congressional quarterly and I'd like to add and it's a very good magazine and I'd like to point out that it's subscription rate is now about 500 dollars per year it gives you an idea of what what the cost is for a magazine with no advertising that's high quality in Germany weekly jounin John wants 20 to 30 percent of its money from subscribe, between 70 and 80% from advertisement so you would destroy a lot of jobs you will not destroy a lot of journals and newspapers without that the fact that there isn't any media covering this I think is really surprises me because it's in their interest to pay attention to the threats there are two commercial free speech and Free Speech in general if you suddenly band advertising in a country where advertising is customary, a lot of newspapers would collapse and the rest would be a few newspapers which would have a more or less Monopoly situation and that would certainly not be conducive to freedom of discussion this is the key which one somebody sometimes tends to forget the most important reason for Relevant freedom of commercial speech is it only that gives you, a benefit when you develop new products as no point in developing new and improved products unless you can communicate in the consumer if your product is bad no amount of advertising will keep you there you can buy your way in but you won't stay there Communications to me is the key weapon of competition you can look at various Industries to see how they become lethargic without that communication weapon without Communications companies are handcuffed in terms of competition without competition you don't have economic growth, people in the United States people in Europe would never ever think of advertising as a human rights issue but if in fact you spent much time in Africa or in or in some parts of Latin America you will know that because the government bans advertising that that effectively shuts out any non-government press there are many journalists all over the world and especially in Africa who regularly go to jail, for saying what they say it's only through Western multinational advertising that in fact popular alternative presses and Free Press can exist outside of the government control press That's particularly true in the third world you can't legislate the good sense or common sense first of all or even good behavior and you can't legislate for the lowest common denominator in Market there's always somebody who wants to be the complete idiot with all due respect, Beckett and that's not how we can steer society when you start restricting the ability of people to use their property to have their property to sell their property you also start restricting their ability to have their lives to exist to make a living to to live in society and to draw these artificial lines I think leads you down the slippery slope these days today are particularly Dangerous Ones in terms of, protecting commercial speech and if I could will one thing it would be an explosion of writing and commentary and Analysis in this area which would alert people including judges to the severity of the risks that lie before us, we all know it's wrong any any ban on commercial free speech is wrong there question is what can we do about it it's got to come up in education it's got to come up in the media articles about it so that people understand that it really is a fundamental issue it's much more than just Banning ads Constitution is very clear on this it says that the government shall make no law abridging freedom of speech doesn't say abridging freedom of speech and adds it doesn't say, except if you say check on college campus there is no caveat in the Constitution it is could not be simpler the First Amendment only really becomes important when you disagree with whatever someone is saying that's what it's really about it doesn't you don't need an amendment with everybody agrees with you when you're speaking out for a minority opinion is when it counts and I think it it is crucial I think it is significant that an international organization like Liberty, Todd has been formed designed to spread First Amendment rights to countries that do not have them enshrined in our constitution as we are fortunate to do",0.8488378823999999,0.6758793,0.9128386
